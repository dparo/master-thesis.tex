  abstract = {Computational experiments show that the greedy algorithm (GR) and the nearest neighbor algorithm (NN), popular choices for tour construction heuristics, work at acceptable level for the Euclidean TSP, but produce very poor results for the general Symmetric and Asymmetric TSP (STSP and ATSP). We prove that for every n{$\geqslant$}2 there is an instance of ATSP (STSP) on n vertices for which GR finds the worst tour. The same result holds for NN. We also analyze the repetitive NN (RNN) that starts NN from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the ATSP, RNN always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2-1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n-2 other tours, n{$\geqslant$}4. We also show that, for some instance of the STSP on n{$\geqslant$}4 vertices, RNN produces a tour not worse than at most 2n-3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the ATSP, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n-2)! tours.},

Shmoys (Eds.), The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Guided Tour of Combinatorial Optimization, Wiley, Chichester, 1985, pp. 145\textendash 180, (Chapter 5)) constructed families of TSP instances with n cities for which the nearest neighbor rule yields a tour-length that is a factor {$\Omega$}(logn) above the length of the optimal tour. We describe two new families of TSP instances, for which the nearest neighbor rule shows the same bad behavior. The instances in the first family are graphical, and the instances in the second family are Euclidean. Our construction and our arguments are extremely simple and suitable for classroom use.},

  abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a new composite heuristic for solving the generalized traveling salesman problem. The proposed heuristic is composed of three phases: the construction of an initial partial solution, the insertion of a node from each non-visited node-subset, and a solution improvement phase. We show that the heuristic performs very well on 36 TSPLIB problems which have been solved to optimality by other researchers. We also propose some simple heuristics that can be used as basic blocks to construct more efficient composite heuristics.},
