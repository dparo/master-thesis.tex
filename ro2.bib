	abstract = {Computational experiments show that the greedy algorithm ({GR}) and the nearest neighbor algorithm ({NN}), popular choices for tour construction heuristics, work at acceptable level for the Euclidean {TSP}, but produce very poor results for the general Symmetric and Asymmetric {TSP} ({STSP} and {ATSP}). We prove that for every n⩾2 there is an instance of {ATSP} ({STSP}) on n vertices for which {GR} finds the worst tour. The same result holds for {NN}. We also analyze the repetitive {NN} ({RNN}) that starts {NN} from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the {ATSP}, {RNN} always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2−1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n−2 other tours, n⩾4. We also show that, for some instance of the {STSP} on n⩾4 vertices, {RNN} produces a tour not worse than at most 2n−3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the {ATSP}, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n−2)! tours.},

The proposed heuristic is composed of three phases: the construction of an initial partial solution, the insertion of a node from each non-visited node-subset, and a solution improvement phase. We show that the heuristic performs very well on 36 {TSPLIB} problems which have been solved to optimality by other researchers. We also propose some simple heuristics that can be used as basic blocks to construct more efficient composite heuristics.},

We describe two new families of {TSP} instances, for which the nearest neighbor rule shows the same bad behavior. The instances in the first family are graphical, and the instances in the second family are Euclidean. Our construction and our arguments are extremely simple and suitable for classroom use.},
