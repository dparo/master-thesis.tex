By using cuts defined by multistars, partial multistars and generalized subtour elimination constraints, we are able to consistently solve 60-city problems to proven optimality and are currently attempting to solve problems involving a hundred cities.

  abstract = {Firms in the durable goods industry occasionally launch trade-in or buyback campaigns to induce replacement purchases by customers. As a result of this, used products (cores) quickly accumulate at the dealers during the campaign periods. We study the reverse logistics problem of such a firm that aims to collect cores from its dealers. Having already established a number of collection centers where inspection of the cores can be performed, the firm's objective is to optimize the routes of a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles each of which will depart from a collection center, visit a number of dealers to pick up cores, and return to the same center. We assume that dealers do not give their cores back free of charge, but they have a reservation price. Therefore, the cores accumulating at a dealer can only be taken back if the acquisition price announced by the firm exceeds the dealer's reservation price. However, the firm is not obliged to visit all dealers; vehicles are dispatched to a dealer only if it is profitable to do so. The problem we focus on becomes an extension of the classical multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in which each visit to a dealer is associated with a gross profit and an acquisition price to be paid to take the cores back. We formulate two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for this problem which we refer to as the selective MDVRP with pricing. Since the problem is NP-hard, we propose a Tabu Search based heuristic method to solve medium and large-sized instances. The performance of the heuristic is quite promising in comparison with solving the MILP models by a state-of-the-art commercial solver. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study the Undirected Capacitated General Routing Problem with Profits (UCGRPP). This problem is defined on an undirected graph where a subset of vertices and edges correspond to customers, which are associated with a given profit and demand. The profit of each customer can be collected at most once. A fleet of homogeneous capacitated vehicles is given to serve the customers. The objective is to find the vehicle routes that maximize the difference between the total collected profit and the traveling cost in such a way that the demand collected by each vehicle does not exceed the capacity and the total duration of each route is not greater than a maximum given time limit. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and introduce valid inequalities to strengthen the corresponding continuous relaxation. Moreover, we provide an aggregate formulation that allows us to introduce further inequalities. Then, we propose a two–phase exact algorithm for the solution of the UCGRPP. In the first phase, a branch-and-cut algorithm is used to solve the aggregate formulation and to identify a cut pool of aggregate valid inequalities to be used in the second phase, where a branch-and-cut algorithm is implemented to optimally solve the UCGRPP. Computational results on a large set of problem instances show that the use of the aggregate formulation is effective, making the two-phase exact algorithm able to optimally solve a large number of instances.},

In this paper, we model the M-RRVRP as a time constrained vehicle routing problem on a multigraph (TVRP-MG). We then formulate the TVRP-MG as a set partitioning problem with an additional constraint and describe an exact method for solving the TVRP-MG. This exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the formulation of the problem. Further, we obtain a valid upper bound and show how this bounding procedure can transform the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. Our computational results show that the proposed method is very effective in deriving an optimal or near optimal solution to the M-RRVRP in a reasonable amount of computing time. Since the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) can be transformed into a TVRP-MG, we tested our procedure on 11 instances of the CVRP. Our computational results show that our procedure very effectively found the optimal solution to 7 of the 11 instances of the CVRP.

This paper presents an exact algorithm for the HVRP based on the set partitioning formulation.

The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of HVRPs, SDVRP and MDVRP show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

The method consists in combining different dual ascent procedures to find a near optimal dual solution of the SP model. Then, a column-and-cut generation algorithm attempts to close the integrality gap left by the dual ascent procedures by adding valid inequalities to the SP formulation. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing all optimal integer solutions that is solved by an integer programming solver. In this paper, we describe how this solution framework can be extended to solve different variants of the VRP by tailoring the different bounding procedures to deal with the constraints of the specific variant. We describe how this solution framework has been recently used to derive exact algorithms for a broad class of VRPs such as the capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, all types of heterogeneous VRP including the multi depot VRP, and the period VRP. The computational results show that the exact algorithm derived for each of these VRP variants outperforms all other exact methods published so far and can solve several test instances that were previously unsolved. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract = {In this chapter we present several set-covering-based approaches for solving the Capacitated VRP (CVRP) and provide an analysis of the effectiveness of the approach. Throughout the chapter we consider the symmetric case, the CVRP, although the presented methods may be applied to the ACVRP as well. For this purpose, let the index set of the n customers be denoted V = \{1, 2,. .. , n\}. We let 0 denote the depot and V 0 = V ∪ \{0\} the node set of the corresponding complete graph. Associated with customer i ∈ V is the demand d i {$>$} 0, which represents the load that must be picked up at customer i's location. We let C denote the vehicle capacity, and we assume there are K vehicles available to perform the delivery. Clearly, feasibility requires that d i ≤ C for each i ∈ V. Let t ij denote the length of edge (i, j) with i, j ∈ V 0. It is assumed that the distances t ij satisfy the triangle inequality; otherwise, one can add a large constant cost to all nodes (or to all edges). A classical method, first suggested by Balinski and Quandt [3], for solving the CVRP is based on formulating the problem as a set-covering problem. The idea is as follows. Enumerate all feasible routes, where a feasible route is one that starts and ends at the depot and picks up a total load not exceeding C. Let the index set of all feasible routes be R = \{1, 2,. .. , R\}. Let c r be the cost (e.g., length) of route r, and let S r ⊆ V denote those customers appearing in route r for all r ∈ R. Define α ir = 1 if customer i is served in route r, 0 otherwise for each customer i ∈ V and each route r ∈ R. Also, for every r ∈ R, let y r = 1 if route r is in the optimal solution, 0 otherwise.}

  abstract = {The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well-known research line in the optimization research community. Its different basic variants have been widely explored in the literature. Even though it has been studied for years, the research around it is still very active. The new tendency is mainly focused on applying this study case to real-life problems. Due to this trend, the Rich VRP arises: combining multiple constraints for tackling realistic problems. Nowadays, some studies have considered specific combinations of real-life constraints to define the emerging Rich VRP scopes. This work surveys the state of the art in the field, summarizing problem combinations, constraints defined, and approaches found.},

  abstract = {The constrained shortest-path problem (CSPP) generalizes the standard shortest-path problem by adding one or more path-weight side constraints. We present a new algorithm for CSPP that Lagrangianizes those constraints, optimizes the resulting Lagrangian function, identifies a feasible solution, and then closes any optimality gap by enumerating near-shortest paths, measured with respect to the Lagrangianized length. "Near-shortest" implies ε-optimal, with a varying ε that equals the current optimality gap. The algorithm exploits a variety of techniques: a new path-enumeration method; aggregated constraints; preprocessing to eliminate edges that cannot form part of an optimal solution; "reprocessing" that reapplies preprocessing steps as improved solutions are found; and, when needed, a "phase-I procedure" to identify a feasible solution before searching for an optimal one. The new algorithm is often an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm on singly constrained randomly generated grid networks. On multiconstrained grid networks, road networks, and networks for aircraft routing the advantage varies but, overall, the new algorithm is competitive with the label-setting algorithm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This problem is NP-hard for P=V-\{s,t\}. In this paper, we develop three new compact formulations for this problem. The first one is based on the spanning tree polytope. The second model is a primal-dual mixed integer model presenting a small number of variables and constraints; and the last one is obtained from a flow-based compact model for the Steiner traveling salesman problem (TSP). Numerical experiments indicate that the second compact model allows the efficient solution of randomly generated and benchmark (from the TSPLIB) instances of the problem with hundreds of nodes.},

The algorithm computes a daily plan for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles that depart from different depots and must visit a set of customers for delivery operations. In this rich vehicle-routing problem (VRP), we consider multiple capacities; time windows associated with depots and customers; incompatibility constraints between goods, depots, vehicles, and customers; maximum route length and duration; upper limits on the number of consecutive driving hours and compulsory drivers' rest periods; the possibility of skipping some customers and using express courier services instead of the given fleet to fulfill some orders; the option of splitting up the orders; and the possibility of open routes that do not terminate at depots. Moreover, the cost of each vehicle route is computed through a system of fees depending on the locations visited by the vehicle, the distance traveled, the vehicle load, and the number of stops along the route. We developed a column generation algorithm where the pricing problem is a particular resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem, solved through a bounded bidirectional dynamic programming algorithm. We describe how to encode the cost function and the complicating constraints by an appropriate use of resources, and we present computational results on real instances obtained from the software company. © 2009 INFORMS.},

We present tree search algorithms for the exact solution of the VRP incorporating lower bounds computed from (i) shortest spanning k-degree centre tree (k-DCT), and (ii)q-routes. The final algorithms also include problem reduction and dominance tests. Computational results are presented for a number of problems derived from the literature. The results show that the bounds derived from the q-routes are superior to those from k-DCT and that VRPs of up to about 25 customers can be solved exactly. © 1981 North-Holland Publishing Company.},

We study how the branch-and-price technique can be applied to the solution of this problem and in particular we compare two different ways of solving the pricing subproblem: exact dynamic programming and state space relaxation. By applying a bidirectional search we experimentally prove its effectiveness in solving the subproblem.

We introduce the common concepts of convexification and discretization to arrive at a Dantzig-Wolfe type reformulation of a mixed integer program. The relation between the original and the extended formulations helps us understand how cutting planes should be formulated and how branching decisions can be taken while keeping the column generation subproblems manageable.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for classifying the literature of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). VRP as a field of study and practice is defined quite broadly. It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

  abstract = {In this article, we propose a solution procedure for the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). A relaxed version of this problem in which the path does not have to be elementary has been the backbone of a number of solution procedures based on column generation for several important problems, such as vehicle routing and crew pairing. In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the ESPPRC, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem. We present computational experiments of this algorithm for our specific problem and embedded in a column generation scheme for the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

CVRP is known to be NP-hard and finds practical applications in distribution and scheduling. We describe two new bounding procedures for CVRP, based on the so-called additive approach. Each procedure computes a sequence of nondecreasing lower bounds, obtained by solving different relaxations of CVRP. Effective implementation of the procedures are also outlined which considerably reduce the computational effort. The two procedures are combined into an overall bounding algorithm. A branch-and-bound exact algorithm is then proposed, whose performance is enhanced by means of reduction procedures, dominance criteria, and feasibility checks. Extensive computational results on both real-world and random test problems are presented, showing that the proposed approach favorably compares with previous algorithms from the literature.},

This paper presents an algorithm that combines both approaches: it works over the intersection of two polytopes, one associated with a traditional Lagrangean relaxation over q-routes, the other defined by bound, degree and capacity constraints. This is equivalent to a linear program with exponentially many variables and constraints that can lead to lower bounds that are superior to those given by previous methods. The resulting branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm can solve to optimality all instances from the literature with up to 135 vertices.

Each cluster is associated to a profit to the cost function, obtained if at least one element in the cluster appears in the path. Several applications can be considered as school bus routing, pricing problems, or telecommunication network design. Thus, depending on the case, clusters could be interpreted as groups of nodes with linking features as, for example, being easily reachable from each other, or some kind of coverage guarantee. We compare the GESPP to similar problems in the literature and we propose a two-phase heuristic algorithm for graphs including negative cycles. Tests on random instances with up to 100 nodes show an average gap of 0.3\% to the best known solutions computed in 2.8s in average. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The ESPPRC often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). As the ESPPRC problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC), which can be solved using a pseudopolynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes unpractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving ESPPRC and SPPRC is to forbid cycles of small length. In the SPPRC with fc-cycle elimination (SPPRC-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k +1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i -j -i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k ≥ 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard VRPTW instances from Solomon's benchmark show that fc-cycle elimination with k {$>$} 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints. The new algorithm has proven to be a key ingredient for getting exact integer solutions for well-known hard problems from the literature. © 2006 INFORMS.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem (CPTP) which is a special case of the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). The CPTP belongs to the group of problems known as traveling salesman problems with profits. In CPTP each customer is associated with a profit and a demand and the objective is to find a capacitated tour (rooted in a depot node) that minimizes the total travel distance minus the profit of the visited customers. The CPTP can be recognized as the sub-problem in many column generation applications, where it is traditionally solved through dynamic programming. In this paper we present an alternative framework based on a formulation for the undirected CPTP and solved through branch-and-cut. Valid inequalities are presented among which we introduce a new family of inequalities for the CPTP denoted rounded multistar inequalities and we prove their validity. Computational experiments are performed on a set of instances known from the literature and a set of newly generated instances. The results indicate that the presented algorithm is highly competitive with the dynamic programming algorithms. In particular, we are able to solve instances with 800 nodes to optimality where the dynamic programming algorithms cannot solve instances with more than 200 nodes. Moreover dynamic programming and branch-and-cut complement each other well, giving us hope for solving more general problems through hybrid approaches. The paper is intended to serve as a platform for further development of branch-and-cut algorithms for CPTP hence also acting as a survey/tutorial.},

An exception is a paper of Luis Gouveia, which shows that a one-commodity flow formulation of Gavish and Graves yields, by projection, certain 'multistar' inequalities in the two-index space. We give a survey of formulations for the capacitated VRP, and then present various results of a similar flavour to those of Gouveia. In particular, we show that: - the three-index formulation, augmented by certain families of valid inequalities, gives the same lower bound as the two-index formulation, augmented by certain simpler families of valid inequalities, - the two-commodity flow formulation of Baldacci et al. gives the same lower bound and the same multistar inequalities as the one-commodity Gavish and Graves formulation, - a certain non-standard multi-commodity flow formulation, with one commodity per customer, implies by projection certain 'hypotour-like' inequalities in the two-index space, - the set partitioning formulation implies by projection both multistar and hypotour-like inequalities in the two-index space. We also briefly look at some other variants of the VRP, such as the VRP with time windows, and derive multistar-like inequalities for them. We also present polynomial-time separation algorithms for some of the new inequalities.},

These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual ORSNZ Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage. We also make improvements to this algorithm and test them computationally. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 53(4), 358-381 2009.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing problems are at the heart of most decision support systems for real-life distribution problems. In vehicle routing problem a set of routes must be determined at lowest total cost for a number of resources (i.e. fleet of vehicles) located at one or several points (e.g. depots, warehouses) to efficiently service a number of demand or supply points. In this paper a new memetic algorithm is suggested for the standard capacitated vehicle routing problem. The proposed algorithm combines the edge assembly (EAX) crossover with two well-known local searches and allows for infeasible solutions with respect to capacity constraint during the search. To address the constraint violation, an efficient modification algorithm is also suggested. Experimental tests on 32 standard benchmarks demonstrate that the suggested method is robust and competitive, finding the best-known solution to 28 problems and new best-known solution to 12 well-studied instances in a reasonable computing time.},

An identification procedure accepts as input the support graph of a point which does not belong to the polytope, and returns as output some of the facet inducing inequalities violated by the point.

We give exact procedures for the subtour elimination and the 2-matching constraints, based on the Gomory-Hu and Padberg-Rao algorithms respectively. Efficient reduction procedures for the input graph are proposed which accelerate these two algorithms substantially. Exact and heuristic shrinking conditions for the input graph are also given that yield efficient procedures for the identification of simple and general comb inequalities and of some elementary clique tree inequalities. These procedures constitute the core of a polytopal cutting plane algorithm that we have devised and programmed to solve a substantial number of large-scale problem instances with sizes up to 2392 nodes to optimality. © 1990 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.},

  abstract = {The best performing exact algorithms for the capacitated vehicle routing problem developed in the last 10 years are based in the combination of cut and column generation. Some authors only used cuts expressed over the variables of the original formulation, in order to keep the pricing subproblem relatively easy. Other authors could reduce the duality gaps by also using a restricted number of cuts over the master LP variables, stopping when the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. A particularly effective family of such cuts are the subset row cuts. This work introduces a technique for greatly reducing the impact on the pricing of these cuts, thus allowing much more cuts to be added. The newly proposed branch-cut-and-price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching. All the instances used for benchmarking exact algorithms, with up to 199 customers, were solved to optimality. Moreover, some larger instances with up to 360 customers, only considered before by heuristic methods, were solved too.},

Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithms for some of the most classical VRP variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a BCP solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of VRPs. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing VRP algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of “packing set” and “elementarity set”. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-VRPs, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

In that way, a simple parameterization enables the use of several branch-cut-and-price advanced elements: automatic stabilization by smoothing, limited-memory rank-1 cuts, enumeration, hierarchical strong branching, and limited discrepancy search diving heuristics. As an original theoretical contribution, we prove that the branching over accumulated resource consumption (Gélinas et al, Ann Oper Res 61(1):91–109, 1995) that does not increase the difficulty of the pricing subproblem is sufficient for those bin packing models. Extensive computational results on instances from the literature show that the VRPSolver models have a performance that is very robust over all those problems, being often superior to the existing exact algorithms on the hardest instances. Several instances could be solved to optimality for the first time.},

  abstract = {We consider the Vehicle Routing Problem, in which a fixed fleet of delivery vehicles of uniform capacity must service known customer demands for a single commodity from a common depot at minimum transit cost. This difficult combinatorial problem contains both the Bin Packing Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as special cases and conceptually lies at the intersection of these two well-studied problems. The capacity constraints of the integer programming formulation of this routing model provide the link between the underlying routing and packing structures. We describe a decomposition-based separation methodology for the capacity constraints that takes advantage of our ability to solve small instances of the TSP efficiently. Specifically, when standard procedures fail to separate a candidate point, we attempt to decompose it into a convex combination of TSP tours; if successful, the tours present in this decomposition are examined for violated capacity constraints; if not, the Farkas Theorem provides a hyperplane separating the point from the TSP polytope. We present some extensions of this basic concept and a general framework within which it can be applied to other combinatorial models. Computational results are given for an implementation within the parallel branch, cut, and price framework SYMPHONY.},

  abstract = {When vehicle routing problems with additional constraints, such as capacity or time windows, are solved via column generation and branch-and-price, it is common that the pricing subproblem requires the computation of a minimum cost constrained path on a graph with costs on the arcs and prizes on the vertices. A common solution technique for this problem is dynamic programming. In this paper we illustrate how the basic dynamic programming algorithm can be improved by bounded bi-directional search and we experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of the enhancement proposed. We consider as benchmark problems the elementary shortest path problems arising as pricing subproblems in branch-and-price algorithms for the capacitated vehicle routing problem, the vehicle routing problem with distribution and collection and the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The resource constrained elementary shortest path problem (RCESPP) arises as a pricing subproblem in branch-and-price algorithms for vehicle-routing problems with additional constraints. We address the optimization of the RCESPP and we present and compare three methods. The first method is a well-known exact dynamic-programming algorithm improved by new ideas, such as bidirectional search with resource-based bounding. The second method consists in a branch-and-bound algorithm, where lower bounds are computed by dynamic-programming with state-space relaxation; we show how bounded bidirectional search can be adapted to statespace relaxation and we present different branching strategies and their hybridization. The third method, called decremental state-space relaxation, is a new one; exact dynamic-programming and state-space relaxation are two special cases of this new method. The experimental comparison of the three methods is definitely favorable to decrement state-space relaxation. Computational results are given for different kinds of resources, arising from the capacitated vehicle-routing problem, the vehicle-routing problem with distribution and collection, and the vehicle-routing problem with capacities and time windows. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We propose a variant of the bidirectional label-correcting algorithm in which the labels are stored and extended according to the so-called bucket graph. This organization of labels helps to significantly decrease the number of dominance checks and the running time of the algorithm. We also show how the forward/backward route symmetry can be exploited and how to eliminate arcs from the bucket graph using reduced costs. The proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for vehicle routing instances with large vehicle capacity and/or with time window constraints. Computational experiments were performed on instances from the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem, including multidepot and site-dependent variants, on the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and on the “nightmare” instances of the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem. Significant improvements over the best algorithms in the literature were achieved, and many instances could be solved for the first time.},

Moreover, we developed a reactive mechanism that dynamically controls the dimension of the SP models when dealing with large size instances. The algorithm was extensively tested on benchmark instances of the following Vechicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants: (i) Capacitated VRP; (ii) Asymmetric VRP; (iii) Open VRP; (iv) VRP with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery; (v) VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery; (vi) Multi-depot VRP; (vii) Multi-depot VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery.

  abstract = {Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition as applied to an integer program is a specific form of problem reformulation that aims at providing a tighter linear programming relaxation bound. The reformulation gives rise to an integer master problem, whose typically large number of variables is dealt with implicitly by using an integer programming column generation procedure, also known as branch-and-price algorithm. There is a large class of integer programs that are well suited for this solution technique. In this paper, we propose to base the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of an integer program on the discretization of the integer polyhedron associated with a subsystem of constraints (as opposed to its convexification). This allows us to formulate the integrality restriction directly on the master variables and sets a theoretical framework for dealing with specific issues such as branching or the introduction of cutting planes in the master. We discuss specific branching schemes and their effect on the structure of the column generation subproblem. We give theoretical bounds on the complexity of the separation process and the extent of the modifications to the column generation subproblem. Our computational tests on the cutting stock problem and a generalisation-the cutting strip problem-show that, in practice, all fractional solutions can be eliminated using branching rules that preserve the tractability of the subproblem, but there is a trade-off between branching efficiency and subproblem tractability.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing attributes are extra characteristics and decisions that complement the academic problem formulations and aim to properly account for real-life application needs. Hundreds of methods have been introduced in recent years for specific attributes, but the development of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efficient and applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efficient general-purpose solver. The proposed Unified Hybrid Genetic Search metaheuristic relies on problem-independent unified local search, genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem specifics are confined to a limited part of the method and are addressed by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components, which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental operators to manage attribute specificities. Extensive computational experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not necessarily go against efficiency for these problem classes.},
