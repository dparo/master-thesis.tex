	abstract = {This paper considers the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem ({CPTP}) which is a special case of the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints ({ESPPRC}). The {CPTP} belongs to the group of problems known as traveling salesman problems with profits. In {CPTP} each customer is associated with a profit and a demand and the objective is to find a capacitated tour (rooted in a depot node) that minimizes the total travel distance minus the profit of the visited customers. The {CPTP} can be recognized as the sub-problem in many column generation applications, where it is traditionally solved through dynamic programming. In this paper we present an alternative framework based on a formulation for the undirected {CPTP} and solved through branch-and-cut. Valid inequalities are presented among which we introduce a new family of inequalities for the {CPTP} denoted rounded multistar inequalities and we prove their validity. Computational experiments are performed on a set of instances known from the literature and a set of newly generated instances. The results indicate that the presented algorithm is highly competitive with the dynamic programming algorithms. In particular, we are able to solve instances with 800 nodes to optimality where the dynamic programming algorithms cannot solve instances with more than 200 nodes. Moreover dynamic programming and branch-and-cut complement each other well, giving us hope for solving more general problems through hybrid approaches. The paper is intended to serve as a platform for further development of branch-and-cut algorithms for {CPTP} hence also acting as a survey/tutorial.},

We introduce a new route relaxation called ng-route, used by different dual ascent heuristics to find near-optimal dual solutions of the {LP}-relaxation of the {SP} model. We describe a column-and-cut generation algorithm strengthened by valid inequalities that uses a new strategy for solving the pricing problem. The new ng-route relaxation and the different dual solutions achieved allow us to generate a reduced {SP} problem containing all routes of any optimal solution that is finally solved by an integer programming solver.

A mathematical model and valid inequalities are presented. Furthermore, a new family of inequalities denoted the generalized capacity inequalities are introduced. Experimental results are performed on a set of benchmark instances generated from well known benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Until now, label algorithms have been the dominant solution method for this problem but experimental results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms on all the generated instances.

	abstract = {The constrained shortest-path problem ({CSPP}) generalizes the standard shortest-path problem by adding one or more path-weight side constraints. We present a new algorithm for {CSPP} that Lagrangianizes those constraints, optimizes the resulting Lagrangian function, identifies a feasible solution, and then closes any optimality gap by enumerating near-shortest paths, measured with respect to the Lagrangianized length. "Near-shortest" implies ε-optimal, with a varying ε that equals the current optimality gap. The algorithm exploits a variety of techniques: a new path-enumeration method; aggregated constraints; preprocessing to eliminate edges that cannot form part of an optimal solution; "reprocessing" that reapplies preprocessing steps as improved solutions are found; and, when needed, a "phase-I procedure" to identify a feasible solution before searching for an optimal one. The new algorithm is often an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm on singly constrained randomly generated grid networks. On multiconstrained grid networks, road networks, and networks for aircraft routing the advantage varies but, overall, the new algorithm is competitive with the label-setting algorithm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Conventional Lagrangean preprocessing for the network Weight Constrained Shortest Path Problem ({WCSPP}), for example Beasley and Christofides (Beasley and Christofides, Networks 19(1989), 379-394), calculates lower bounds on the cost of using each node and edge in a feasible path using a single optimal Lagrange multiplier for the relaxation of the {WCSPP}. These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual {ORSNZ} Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage.

In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the {ESPPRC}, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem.

We give a survey of formulations for the capacitated {VRP}, and then present various results of a similar flavour to those of Gouveia. In particular, we show that: - the three-index formulation, augmented by certain families of valid inequalities, gives the same lower bound as the two-index formulation, augmented by certain simpler families of valid inequalities, - the two-commodity flow formulation of Baldacci et al. gives the same lower bound and the same multistar inequalities as the one-commodity Gavish and Graves formulation, - a certain non-standard multi-commodity flow formulation, with one commodity per customer, implies by projection certain 'hypotour-like' inequalities in the two-index space, - the set partitioning formulation implies by projection both multistar and hypotour-like inequalities in the two-index space. We also briefly look at some other variants of the {VRP}, such as the {VRP} with time windows, and derive multistar-like inequalities for them.

In this rich vehicle-routing problem ({VRP}), we consider multiple capacities; time windows associated with depots and customers; incompatibility constraints between goods, depots, vehicles, and customers; maximum route length and duration; upper limits on the number of consecutive driving hours and compulsory drivers' rest periods; the possibility of skipping some customers and using express courier services instead of the given fleet to fulfill some orders; the option of splitting up the orders; and the possibility of open routes that do not terminate at depots. Moreover, the cost of each vehicle route is computed through a system of fees depending on the locations visited by the vehicle, the distance traveled, the vehicle load, and the number of stops along the route. We developed a column generation algorithm where the pricing problem is a particular resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem, solved through a bounded bidirectional dynamic programming algorithm. We describe how to encode the cost function and the complicating constraints by an appropriate use of resources, and we present computational results on real instances obtained from the software company. © 2009 {INFORMS}.},

We address the optimization of the {RCESPP} and we present and compare three methods.

The second method consists in a branch-and-bound algorithm, where lower bounds are computed by dynamic-programming with state-space relaxation; we show how bounded bidirectional search can be adapted to statespace relaxation and we present different branching strategies and their hybridization. The third method, called decremental state-space relaxation, is a new one; exact dynamic-programming and state-space relaxation are two special cases of this new method. The experimental comparison of the three methods is definitely favorable to decrement state-space relaxation.

We give exact procedures for the subtour elimination and the 2-matching constraints, based on the Gomory-Hu and Padberg-Rao algorithms respectively. Efficient reduction procedures for the input graph are proposed which accelerate these two algorithms substantially. Exact and heuristic shrinking conditions for the input graph are also given that yield efficient procedures for the identification of simple and general comb inequalities and of some elementary clique tree inequalities.

In this paper, we model the M-{RRVRP} as a time constrained vehicle routing problem on a multigraph ({TVRP}-{MG}). We then formulate the {TVRP}-{MG} as a set partitioning problem with an additional constraint and describe an exact method for solving the {TVRP}-{MG}. This exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the formulation of the problem. Further, we obtain a valid upper bound and show how this bounding procedure can transform the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. Our computational results show that the proposed method is very effective in deriving an optimal or near optimal solution to the M-{RRVRP} in a reasonable amount of computing time. Since the capacitated vehicle routing problem ({CVRP}) can be transformed into a {TVRP}-{MG}, we tested our procedure on 11 instances of the {CVRP}. Our computational results show that our procedure very effectively found the optimal solution to 7 of the 11 instances of the {CVRP}.

	abstract = {Firms in the durable goods industry occasionally launch trade-in or buyback campaigns to induce replacement purchases by customers. As a result of this, used products (cores) quickly accumulate at the dealers during the campaign periods. We study the reverse logistics problem of such a firm that aims to collect cores from its dealers. Having already established a number of collection centers where inspection of the cores can be performed, the firm's objective is to optimize the routes of a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles each of which will depart from a collection center, visit a number of dealers to pick up cores, and return to the same center. We assume that dealers do not give their cores back free of charge, but they have a reservation price. Therefore, the cores accumulating at a dealer can only be taken back if the acquisition price announced by the firm exceeds the dealer's reservation price. However, the firm is not obliged to visit all dealers; vehicles are dispatched to a dealer only if it is profitable to do so. The problem we focus on becomes an extension of the classical multi-depot vehicle routing problem ({MDVRP}) in which each visit to a dealer is associated with a gross profit and an acquisition price to be paid to take the cores back. We formulate two mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) models for this problem which we refer to as the selective {MDVRP} with pricing. Since the problem is {NP}-hard, we propose a Tabu Search based heuristic method to solve medium and large-sized instances. The performance of the heuristic is quite promising in comparison with solving the {MILP} models by a state-of-the-art commercial solver. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({ESPPRC}) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The {ESPPRC} often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows ({VRPTW}). As the {ESPPRC} problem is {NP}-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({SPPRC}), which can be solved using a pseudopolynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes unpractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving {ESPPRC} and {SPPRC} is to forbid cycles of small length. In the {SPPRC} with fc-cycle elimination ({SPPRC}-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k +1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i -j -i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k ≥ 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard {VRPTW} instances from Solomon's benchmark show that fc-cycle elimination with k {\textgreater} 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints.

Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price ({BCP}) algorithms for some of the most classical {VRP} variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a {BCP} solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of {VRPs}. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing {VRP} algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of “packing set” and “elementarity set”. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-{VRPs}, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

The exact algorithm uses three types of bounding procedures based on the {LP}-relaxation and on the Lagrangean relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of {HVRPs}, {SDVRP} and {MDVRP} show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

We also show how the forward/backward route symmetry can be exploited and how to eliminate arcs from the bucket graph using reduced costs. The proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for vehicle routing instances with large vehicle capacity and/or with time window constraints. Computational experiments were performed on instances from the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem, including multidepot and site-dependent variants, on the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and on the “nightmare” instances of the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem.

In that way, a simple parameterization enables the use of several branch-cut-and-price advanced elements: automatic stabilization by smoothing, limited-memory rank-1 cuts, enumeration, hierarchical strong branching, and limited discrepancy search diving heuristics. As an original theoretical contribution, we prove that the branching over accumulated resource consumption (Gélinas et al, Ann Oper Res 61(1):91–109, 1995) that does not increase the difficulty of the pricing subproblem is sufficient for those bin packing models. Extensive computational results on instances from the literature show that the {VRPSolver} models have a performance that is very robust over all those problems, being often superior to the existing exact algorithms on the hardest instances.

The reformulation gives rise to an integer master problem, whose typically large number of variables is dealt with implicitly by using an integer programming column generation procedure, also known as branch-and-price algorithm. There is a large class of integer programs that are well suited for this solution technique. In this paper, we propose to base the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of an integer program on the discretization of the integer polyhedron associated with a subsystem of constraints (as opposed to its convexification). This allows us to formulate the integrality restriction directly on the master variables and sets a theoretical framework for dealing with specific issues such as branching or the introduction of cutting planes in the master. We discuss specific branching schemes and their effect on the structure of the column generation subproblem. We give theoretical bounds on the complexity of the separation process and the extent of the modifications to the column generation subproblem. Our computational tests on the cutting stock problem and a generalisation-the cutting strip problem-show that, in practice, all fractional solutions can be eliminated using branching rules that preserve the tractability of the subproblem, but there is a trade-off between branching efficiency and subproblem tractability.},

Other authors could reduce the duality gaps by also using a restricted number of cuts over the master {LP} variables, stopping when the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. A particularly effective family of such cuts are the subset row cuts. This work introduces a technique for greatly reducing the impact on the pricing of these cuts, thus allowing much more cuts to be added. The newly proposed branch-cut-and-price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching.

	abstract = {In this chapter we present several set-covering-based approaches for solving the Capacitated {VRP} ({CVRP}) and provide an analysis of the effectiveness of the approach. Throughout the chapter we consider the symmetric case, the {CVRP}, although the presented methods may be applied to the {ACVRP} as well. For this purpose, let the index set of the n customers be denoted V = \{1, 2,. .. , n\}. We let 0 denote the depot and V 0 = V ∪ \{0\} the node set of the corresponding complete graph. Associated with customer i ∈ V is the demand d i {\textgreater} 0, which represents the load that must be picked up at customer i's location. We let C denote the vehicle capacity, and we assume there are K vehicles available to perform the delivery. Clearly, feasibility requires that d i ≤ C for each i ∈ V. Let t ij denote the length of edge (i, j) with i, j ∈ V 0. It is assumed that the distances t ij satisfy the triangle inequality; otherwise, one can add a large constant cost to all nodes (or to all edges). A classical method, first suggested by Balinski and Quandt [3], for solving the {CVRP} is based on formulating the problem as a set-covering problem. The idea is as follows. Enumerate all feasible routes, where a feasible route is one that starts and ends at the depot and picks up a total load not exceeding C. Let the index set of all feasible routes be R = \{1, 2,. .. , R\}. Let c r be the cost (e.g., length) of route r, and let S r ⊆ V denote those customers appearing in route r for all r ∈ R. Define α ir = 1 if customer i is served in route r, 0 otherwise for each customer i ∈ V and each route r ∈ R. Also, for every r ∈ R, let y r = 1 if route r is in the optimal solution, 0 otherwise.},

This problem is defined on an undirected graph where a subset of vertices and edges correspond to customers, which are associated with a given profit and demand. The profit of each customer can be collected at most once. A fleet of homogeneous capacitated vehicles is given to serve the customers. The objective is to find the vehicle routes that maximize the difference between the total collected profit and the traveling cost in such a way that the demand collected by each vehicle does not exceed the capacity and the total duration of each route is not greater than a maximum given time limit. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and introduce valid inequalities to strengthen the corresponding continuous relaxation. Moreover, we provide an aggregate formulation that allows us to introduce further inequalities. Then, we propose a two–phase exact algorithm for the solution of the {UCGRPP}. In the first phase, a branch-and-cut algorithm is used to solve the aggregate formulation and to identify a cut pool of aggregate valid inequalities to be used in the second phase, where a branch-and-cut algorithm is implemented to optimally solve the {UCGRPP}. Computational results on a large set of problem instances show that the use of the aggregate formulation is effective, making the two-phase exact algorithm able to optimally solve a large number of instances.},

The procedure is also applicable to other routing problems, such as variants of travelling salesman or shortest Hamiltonian path problems, on directed graphs. The proposed procedure is based on computing the strong components of the support graph. The procedure possesses a better worst-case time complexity than the standard way of separating {SECs}, which uses maximum ﬂow algorithms, and is easier to implement.},
