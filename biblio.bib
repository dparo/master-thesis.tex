  abstract = {Human operators often diagnose industrial machinery via anomalous sounds. Automated acoustic anomaly detection can lead to reliable maintenance of machinery. However, deep learning-driven anomaly detection methods often require an extensive amount of computational resources which prohibits their deployment in factories. Here we explore a machine-driven design exploration strategy to create OutlierNets, a family of highly compact deep convolutional autoencoder network architectures featuring as few as 686 parameters , model sizes as small as 2.7 KB, and as low as 2.8 million FLOPs, with a detection accuracy matching or exceeding published architectures with as many as 4 million parameters. Furthermore, CPU-accelerated latency experiments show that the OutlierNet architectures can achieve as much as 21x lower latency than published networks.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices, such as sensors and smart devices that have processing, sensing, and communication capabilities, as well as can transmit information to each other and a supreme console through the Internet. Network traffic prediction is an important operational and management function for any data network. It has a significant role in today's increasingly complex and diverse networks. Network traffic prediction is also more important for IoT networks to provide reliable communication. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction. In this paper, we perform the IoT traffic time series prediction using a multistep ahead prediction with Time Series NARX Feedback Neural Networks. The estimation error of a prediction approach has been evaluated using the performance functions MSE, SSE, and MAE, besides, another measure of prediction accuracy the mean absolute percent of error (MAPE).},

In this paper, a directed information (DI) learning framework is proposed to predict the source traffic in eventdriven MTC. By capturing the history of transmissions during past events by a sequence of binary random variables, the DI between different machine type devices (MTDs) is calculated and used for predicting the set of possible MTDs that are likely to report an event. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed DI learning method can reveal the correlation between transmission from different MTDs that report the same event, and the order in which they transmit their data. The proposed algorithm and the presented results show that the DI can be used to implement effective predictive resource allocation for eventdriven MTC.},

  abstract = {Firms in the durable goods industry occasionally launch trade-in or buyback campaigns to induce replacement purchases by customers. As a result of this, used products (cores) quickly accumulate at the dealers during the campaign periods. We study the reverse logistics problem of such a firm that aims to collect cores from its dealers. Having already established a number of collection centers where inspection of the cores can be performed, the firm's objective is to optimize the routes of a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles each of which will depart from a collection center, visit a number of dealers to pick up cores, and return to the same center. We assume that dealers do not give their cores back free of charge, but they have a reservation price. Therefore, the cores accumulating at a dealer can only be taken back if the acquisition price announced by the firm exceeds the dealer's reservation price. However, the firm is not obliged to visit all dealers; vehicles are dispatched to a dealer only if it is profitable to do so. The problem we focus on becomes an extension of the classical multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) in which each visit to a dealer is associated with a gross profit and an acquisition price to be paid to take the cores back. We formulate two mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models for this problem which we refer to as the selective MDVRP with pricing. Since the problem is NP-hard, we propose a Tabu Search based heuristic method to solve medium and large-sized instances. The performance of the heuristic is quite promising in comparison with solving the MILP models by a state-of-the-art commercial solver. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce and study the Undirected Capacitated General Routing Problem with Profits (UCGRPP). This problem is defined on an undirected graph where a subset of vertices and edges correspond to customers, which are associated with a given profit and demand. The profit of each customer can be collected at most once. A fleet of homogeneous capacitated vehicles is given to serve the customers. The objective is to find the vehicle routes that maximize the difference between the total collected profit and the traveling cost in such a way that the demand collected by each vehicle does not exceed the capacity and the total duration of each route is not greater than a maximum given time limit. We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and introduce valid inequalities to strengthen the corresponding continuous relaxation. Moreover, we provide an aggregate formulation that allows us to introduce further inequalities. Then, we propose a two\textendash phase exact algorithm for the solution of the UCGRPP. In the first phase, a branch-and-cut algorithm is used to solve the aggregate formulation and to identify a cut pool of aggregate valid inequalities to be used in the second phase, where a branch-and-cut algorithm is implemented to optimally solve the UCGRPP. Computational results on a large set of problem instances show that the use of the aggregate formulation is effective, making the two-phase exact algorithm able to optimally solve a large number of instances.},

In this paper, we model the M-RRVRP as a time constrained vehicle routing problem on a multigraph (TVRP-MG). We then formulate the TVRP-MG as a set partitioning problem with an additional constraint and describe an exact method for solving the TVRP-MG. This exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the formulation of the problem. Further, we obtain a valid upper bound and show how this bounding procedure can transform the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. Our computational results show that the proposed method is very effective in deriving an optimal or near optimal solution to the M-RRVRP in a reasonable amount of computing time. Since the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) can be transformed into a TVRP-MG, we tested our procedure on 11 instances of the CVRP. Our computational results show that our procedure very effectively found the optimal solution to 7 of the 11 instances of the CVRP. In many cases, our procedure was at least 10 times faster than the procedure proposed by Fukasawa et al. Integer programming and combinatorial optimization, vol. 10.

The first dual heuristic is based on the q-route relaxation of the set partitioning formulation of the CVRP. The second one combines Lagrangean relaxation, pricing and cut generation. The third attempts to close the duality gap left by the first two procedures using a classical pricing and cut generation technique. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing only the routes whose reduced costs are smaller than the gap between an upper bound and the lower bound achieved.

The HVRP model considered in this paper contains as special cases: the Single Depot CVRP, all variants of the HVRP presented in the literature, the Site-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) and the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP). This paper presents an exact algorithm for the HVRP based on the set partitioning formulation. The exact algorithm uses three types of bounding procedures based on the LP-relaxation and on the Lagrangean relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of HVRPs, SDVRP and MDVRP show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered. \textcopyright{} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

The method consists in combining different dual ascent procedures to find a near optimal dual solution of the SP model. Then, a column-and-cut generation algorithm attempts to close the integrality gap left by the dual ascent procedures by adding valid inequalities to the SP formulation. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing all optimal integer solutions that is solved by an integer programming solver. In this paper, we describe how this solution framework can be extended to solve different variants of the VRP by tailoring the different bounding procedures to deal with the constraints of the specific variant. We describe how this solution framework has been recently used to derive exact algorithms for a broad class of VRPs such as the capacitated VRP, the VRP with time windows, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, all types of heterogeneous VRP including the multi depot VRP, and the period VRP. The computational results show that the exact algorithm derived for each of these VRP variants outperforms all other exact methods published so far and can solve several test instances that were previously unsolved. \textcopyright{} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

Programming 115(2) 351-385] for the cvrp. The proposed algorithm is based on the set partitioning (SP) formulation of the problem. We introduce a new route relaxation called ng-route, used by different dual ascent heuristics to find near-optimal dual solutions of the LP-relaxation of the SP model. We describe a column-and-cut generation algorithm strengthened by valid inequalities that uses a new strategy for solving the pricing problem. The new ng-route relaxation and the different dual solutions achieved allow us to generate a reduced SP problem containing all routes of any optimal solution that is finally solved by an integer programming solver. The proposed method solves four of the five open Solomon's vrptw instances and significantly improves the running times of state-of-the-art algorithms for both vrptw and cvrp.

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce the class of beta seasonal autoregressive moving average ({$\beta$} SARMA) models for modeling and forecasting time series data that assume values in the standard unit interval. It generalizes the class of beta autoregressive moving average models [Rocha and Cribari-Neto, Test, 2009] by incorporating seasonal dynamics to the model dynamic structure. Besides introducing the new class of models, we develop parameter estimation, hypothesis testing inference, and diagnostic analysis tools. We also discuss out-of-sample forecasting. In particular, we provide closed-form expressions for the conditional score vector and for the conditional Fisher information matrix. We also evaluate the finite sample performances of conditional maximum likelihood estimators and white noise tests using Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application is presented and discussed.},

This is the problem of a traveller with a budget of various resources who has to reach a given destination as quickly as possible within the resource constraints imposed by his budget. A lagrangean relaxation of the integer programming formulation of the problem into a minimum cost network flow problem (which in certain circumstances reduces to an unconstrained shortest path problem) is developed which provides a lower bound for use in a tree search procedure. Problem reduction tests based on both the original problem and this lagrangean relaxation are given. Computational results are presented for the solution of problems involving up to 500 vertices, 5000 arcs, and 10 resources. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new model of M2M traffic of wireless sensor networks. Internet of Things traffic is a significant component of modern networks traffic. Such traffic is used today by modern M2M devices. The peculiarity of M2M traffic consists in its generation by a large number of devices. The number of such devices can be many times greater than the number of regular users. The share of this traffic is more than an order of magnitude less than the video traffic. M2M device traffic is poorly understood and much less predictable. Thus, when developing new technologies, it is necessary to focus a lot on this traffic. The paper contains the results of M2M traffic analysis and develops model of M2M traffic. The 3GPP model was chosen as the base model. The analysis of this model is given, and also its modification is offered. This model allows to simulate the traffic at the unlimited time interval. A feature of this model is the stability characteristics of the devices. It allows to evaluate not only the initial attempts to transmit messages, but also attempts caused by reduced service quality. The mathematical description of the model and simulation results are obtained in the research. It describes the traffic of M2M devices and its impact on quality of service in the network. The obtained results can be used to model the traffic of M2M devices and to select their parameters. In addition, algorithms have been developed to control M2M devices during possible overloads.},

From these insights, we propose a modification to the training regime of {$\beta$}-VAE, that progressively increases the information capacity of the latent code during training. This modification facilitates the robust learning of disentangled representations in {$\beta$}-VAE, without the previous trade-off in reconstruction accuracy.},

Due to this trend, the Rich VRP arises: combining multiple constraints for tackling realistic problems. Nowadays, some studies have considered specific combinations of real-life constraints to define the emerging Rich VRP scopes. This work surveys the state of the art in the field, summarizing problem combinations, constraints defined, and approaches found.},

  abstract = {The constrained shortest-path problem (CSPP) generalizes the standard shortest-path problem by adding one or more path-weight side constraints. We present a new algorithm for CSPP that Lagrangianizes those constraints, optimizes the resulting Lagrangian function, identifies a feasible solution, and then closes any optimality gap by enumerating near-shortest paths, measured with respect to the Lagrangianized length. "Near-shortest" implies {$\epsilon$}-optimal, with a varying {$\epsilon$} that equals the current optimality gap. The algorithm exploits a variety of techniques: a new path-enumeration method; aggregated constraints; preprocessing to eliminate edges that cannot form part of an optimal solution; "reprocessing" that reapplies preprocessing steps as improved solutions are found; and, when needed, a "phase-I procedure" to identify a feasible solution before searching for an optimal one. The new algorithm is often an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm on singly constrained randomly generated grid networks.

Given two nodes s and t of V, we are interested in the problem of determining a shortest-path from s to t in G that must visit only once all nodes of a given set P{$\subseteq$}V-\{s,t\}. This problem is NP-hard for P=V-\{s,t\}. In this paper, we develop three new compact formulations for this problem. The first one is based on the spanning tree polytope. The second model is a primal-dual mixed integer model presenting a small number of variables and constraints; and the last one is obtained from a flow-based compact model for the Steiner traveling salesman problem (TSP). Numerical experiments indicate that the second compact model allows the efficient solution of randomly generated and benchmark (from the TSPLIB) instances of the problem with hundreds of nodes.},

  abstract = {Machine-Type Communication is essential to make the Internet of Things real. This new kind of communication, however, entails a lot of challenges that need to be addressed, especially for what concerns the integration between the human\- triggered traffic, i.e., the traffic generated by the people through smartphones and tablets, and machine-triggered traffic, i.e., the data that are autonomously generated by Machine-Type Devices, in the next generation cellular networks, i.e., the SG. These two types of traffic are completely different, but while the former has been widely studied and appropriately modeled, the latter is still lacking a generally accepted model. In this paper, after a brief survey on traffic models that have been proposed by the academic and the standardization community, we propose and test a general framework to evaluate the performance of a generic cellular network architecture in the context of joint human-triggered and machine-triggered traffic.},

  abstract = {We present an optimization algorithm developed for a provider of software-planning tools for distribution logistics companies. The algorithm computes a daily plan for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles that depart from different depots and must visit a set of customers for delivery operations. In this rich vehicle-routing problem (VRP), we consider multiple capacities; time windows associated with depots and customers; incompatibility constraints between goods, depots, vehicles, and customers; maximum route length and duration; upper limits on the number of consecutive driving hours and compulsory drivers' rest periods; the possibility of skipping some customers and using express courier services instead of the given fleet to fulfill some orders; the option of splitting up the orders; and the possibility of open routes that do not terminate at depots. Moreover, the cost of each vehicle route is computed through a system of fees depending on the locations visited by the vehicle, the distance traveled, the vehicle load, and the number of stops along the route. We developed a column generation algorithm where the pricing problem is a particular resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem, solved through a bounded bidirectional dynamic programming algorithm. We describe how to encode the cost function and the complicating constraints by an appropriate use of resources, and we present computational results on real instances obtained from the software company. \textcopyright{} 2009 INFORMS.},

The worst-case complexity of the known algorithms for this problem being too high, the elementary-path constraint is usually relaxed. Indeed, as each customer must be visited exactly once, the two problems with and without the elementary-path constraint have the same optimal integer solutions. In this article, we propose one theoretical and several practical improvements to the algorithm for elementary paths. We obtain better lower bounds and pruning of the search tree, and these improvements allowed us to find an exact solution to 17 instances of the Solomon benchmark suite which were previously open.},

  abstract = {Unlike traditional programs (such as operating systems or word processors) which have large amounts of code, machine learning tasks use programs with relatively small amounts of code (written in machine learning libraries), but voluminous amounts of data. Just like developers of traditional programs debug errors in their code, developers of machine learning tasks debug and fix errors in their data. However, algorithms and tools for debugging and fixing errors in data are less common, when compared to their counterparts for detecting and fixing errors in code. In this paper, we consider classification tasks where errors in training data lead to misclassifications in test points, and propose an automated method to find the root causes of such misclassifications. Our root cause analysis is based on Pearl's theory of causation, and uses Pearl's PS (Probability of Sufficiency) as a scoring metric. Our implementation, Psi, encodes the computation of PS as a probabilistic program, and uses recent work on probabilistic programs and transformations on probabilistic programs (along with gray-box models of machine learning algorithms) to efficiently compute PS. Psi is able to identify root causes of data errors in interesting data sets.},

We present tree search algorithms for the exact solution of the VRP incorporating lower bounds computed from (i) shortest spanning k-degree centre tree (k-DCT), and (ii)q-routes. The final algorithms also include problem reduction and dominance tests. Computational results are presented for a number of problems derived from the literature. The results show that the bounds derived from the q-routes are superior to those from k-DCT and that VRPs of up to about 25 customers can be solved exactly. \textcopyright{} 1981 North-Holland Publishing Company.},

  abstract = {The vector representations of fixed dimensionality for words (in text) offered by Word2Vec have been shown to be very useful in many application scenarios, in particular due to the semantic information they carry. This paper proposes a parallel version, the Audio Word2Vec. It offers the vector representations of fixed dimensionality for variable-length audio segments. These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with very attractive real world applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection (STD). In this STD application, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the conventional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based approaches at significantly lower computation requirements. We propose unsupervised learning of Audio Word2Vec from audio data without human annotation using Sequence-to-sequence Audoencoder (SA). SA consists of two RNNs equipped with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units: the first RNN (encoder) maps the input audio sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second RNN (decoder) maps the representation back to the input audio sequence. The two RNNs are jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (DSA) is furthered proposed offering more robust learning.},

In this paper, we propose an adaptive access mechanism that can be seamlessly incorporated into IEEE 802.11ah protocol operation and that supports all potential M2M reporting regimes, which are periodic, on-demand, and alarm reporting. The proposed access method is based on a periodically reoccurring pool of time slots, whose size is proactively determined on the basis of the reporting activity in the cell. We show that it is possible to both efficiently and reliably resolve all reporting stations in the cell, within the limits of the allowed deadlines. As a side result, we also provide a rationale for modeling the interarrival time in alarm events by using the Beta distribution, a model that is considered in the 3GPP standardization.},

Different model selection strategies are considered, including one that uses data resampling. Simulation evidence on the frequency of correct model selection favors the bootstrap-based approach. Model selection based on information criteria outperforms that based on forecasting accuracy measures. A forecasting analysis of the proportion of stored hydroelectric energy in South Brazil is presented and discussed. The empirical evidence shows that model selection based on data resampling typically leads to more accurate out-of-sample forecasts.},

It is assumed that the observations follow a one-parameter exponential family of distributions given an accompanying process that evolves as a function of lagged observations. We employ an iterated random function approach and a special coupling technique to show that, under suitable conditions on the parameter space, the conditional mean process is a geometric moment contracting Markov chain and that the observation process is absolutely regular with geometrically decaying coefficients. Asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters is established under some mild assumptions. These models are applied to two examples; the first is the number of transactions per minute of Ericsson stock and the second is related to return times of extreme events of Goldman Sachs Group stock.},

We study how the branch-and-price technique can be applied to the solution of this problem and in particular we compare two different ways of solving the pricing subproblem: exact dynamic programming and state space relaxation. By applying a bidirectional search we experimentally prove its effectiveness in solving the subproblem. We also devise suitable branching strategies for both the exact and the relaxed approach and we report on an extensive set of computational experiments on benchmark instances with both simple and composite demands. \textcopyright{} 2006 INFORMS.},

When the relaxation in each node of a branch-and- bound tree is solved by column generation, one speaks of branch-and-price. Optionally, cutting planes can be added in order to strengthen the relaxation, and this is called branch- price-and-cut. We introduce the common concepts of convexification and discretization to arrive at a Dantzig-Wolfe type reformulation of a mixed integer program. The relation between the original and the extended formulations helps us understand how cutting planes should be formulated and how branching decisions can be taken while keeping the column generation subproblems manageable.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for classifying the literature of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). VRP as a field of study and practice is defined quite broadly. It is considered to encompass all of the managerial, physical, geographical, and informational considerations as well as the theoretic disciplines impacting this ever emerging-field. Over its lifespan the VRP literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difficult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to traffic management. Consequently, this paper defines VRP's domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the VRP literature, and delineates all of VRP's facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classified to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published VRP taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the VRP literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the VRP literature.},

A relaxed version of this problem in which the path does not have to be elementary has been the backbone of a number of solution procedures based on column generation for several important problems, such as vehicle routing and crew pairing. In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the ESPPRC, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem. We present computational experiments of this algorithm for our specific problem and embedded in a column generation scheme for the classical Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. \textcopyright{} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The past 10 years have witnessed the rapid growth of global mobile cellular traffic demands due to the popularity of mobile devices. While accurate traffic prediction becomes extremely important for stable and high-quality Internet service, the performance of existing methods is still poor due to three challenges: complicated temporal variations including burstiness and long periods, multi-variant impact factors such as the point of interest and day of the week, and potential spatial dependencies introduced by the movement of population. While existing traditional methods fail in characterizing these features, especially the latter two, deep learning models with powerful representation ability give us a chance to consider these from a new perspective. In this article, we propose Deep Traffic Predictor (DeepTP), a deep-learning-based end-toend model, which forecasts traffic demands from spatial-dependent and long-period cellular traffic. DeepTP consists of two components: a general feature extractor for modeling spatial dependencies and encoding the external information, and a sequential module for modeling complicated temporal variations. In the general feature extractor, we introduce a correlation selection mechanism for a spatial modeling and embedding mechanism to encode external information. Moreover, we apply a seq2seq model with attention mechanism to build the sequential model. Extensive experiments based on large-scale mobile cellular traffic data demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction models by more than 12.31 percent.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

CVRP is known to be NP-hard and finds practical applications in distribution and scheduling. We describe two new bounding procedures for CVRP, based on the so-called additive approach. Each procedure computes a sequence of nondecreasing lower bounds, obtained by solving different relaxations of CVRP. Effective implementation of the procedures are also outlined which considerably reduce the computational effort. The two procedures are combined into an overall bounding algorithm. A branch-and-bound exact algorithm is then proposed, whose performance is enhanced by means of reduction procedures, dominance criteria, and feasibility checks. Extensive computational results on both real-world and random test problems are presented, showing that the proposed approach favorably compares with previous algorithms from the literature.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of intervention effects generating various types of outliers in a linear count time series model. This model belongs to the class of observation driven models and extends the class of Gaussian linear time series models within the exponential family framework. Studies about effects of covariates and interventions for count time series models have largely fallen behind due to the fact that the underlying process, whose behavior determines the dynamics of the observed process, is not observed. We suggest a computationally feasible approach to these problems, focusing especially on the detection and estimation of sudden shifts and outliers. To identify successfully such unusual events we employ the maximum of score tests, whose critical values in finite samples are determined by parametric bootstrap. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated using simulated and real data examples.},

This paper presents an algorithm that combines both approaches: it works over the intersection of two polytopes, one associated with a traditional Lagrangean relaxation over q-routes, the other defined by bound, degree and capacity constraints. This is equivalent to a linear program with exponentially many variables and constraints that can lead to lower bounds that are superior to those given by previous methods. The resulting branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm can solve to optimality all instances from the literature with up to 135 vertices. This more than doubles the size of the instances that can be consistently solved.},

To better capture long-range global context, a recent trend is to add a self-attention mechanism on top of the CNN, forming a CNN-attention hybrid model. However, it is unclear whether the reliance on a CNN is necessary, and if neural networks purely based on attention are sufficient to obtain good performance in audio classification. In this paper, we answer the question by introducing the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), the first convolution-free, purely attention-based model for audio classification. We evaluate AST on various audio classification benchmarks, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results of 0.485 mAP on AudioSet, 95.6\% accuracy on ESC-50, and 98.1\% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.},

The VRP is closely related to delivery-type problems and appears in a large number of practical situations concerning the distribution of commodities. The present work focuses on a commodity flow formulation presented by Gavish and Graves. This formulation includes two sets of variables and, hence, it also must include coupling constraints between the two sets of variables. These coupling constraints can be defined in several ways. The main result of this work establishes that when the strongest form of the coupling constraints is used in the flow formulation, the equivalent formulation using only the Xq variables satisfies the so called multistar constraints which, for certain parameters, induce facets of the non-directed VRP polytope. Using an idea taken from Gouveia, we show how to derive a more compact representation, in the number of constraints, of the multistar constraints. Some consequences of our projection result are also discussed.},

In this work, we propose to use deep fully convolutional denoising autoencoders (CDAEs) for monaural audio source separation. We use as many CDAEs as the number of sources to be separated from the mixed signal. Each CDAE is trained to separate one source and treats the other sources as background noise. The main idea is to allow each CDAE to learn suitable spectral-temporal filters and features to its corresponding source. Our experimental results show that CDAEs perform source separation slightly better than the deep feedforward neural networks (FNNs) even with fewer parameters than FNNs.},

  abstract = {We introduce the generalized elementary shortest path problem (GESPP) where in addition to the features of the shortest path problem, nodes belong to predefined non-disjoint clusters. Each cluster is associated to a profit to the cost function, obtained if at least one element in the cluster appears in the path. Several applications can be considered as school bus routing, pricing problems, or telecommunication network design. Thus, depending on the case, clusters could be interpreted as groups of nodes with linking features as, for example, being easily reachable from each other, or some kind of coverage guarantee. We compare the GESPP to similar problems in the literature and we propose a two-phase heuristic algorithm for graphs including negative cycles. Tests on random instances with up to 100 nodes show an average gap of 0.3\% to the best known solutions computed in 2.8s in average. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Computational experiments show that the greedy algorithm (GR) and the nearest neighbor algorithm (NN), popular choices for tour construction heuristics, work at acceptable level for the Euclidean TSP, but produce very poor results for the general Symmetric and Asymmetric TSP (STSP and ATSP). We prove that for every n{$\geqslant$}2 there is an instance of ATSP (STSP) on n vertices for which GR finds the worst tour. The same result holds for NN. We also analyze the repetitive NN (RNN) that starts NN from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the ATSP, RNN always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2-1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n-2 other tours, n{$\geqslant$}4. We also show that, for some instance of the STSP on n{$\geqslant$}4 vertices, RNN produces a tour not worse than at most 2n-3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the ATSP, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n-2)! tours.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers\textemdash 8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advances in the power generation and information technologies areas are helping to change the modern electricity supply system in order to comply with higher energy efficiency and sustainability standards. Smart grids are an emerging trend that introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve enough information about the grid operation together with other context data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which are also shown in this article.},

However, when this generative model is expressed as a powerful neural network such as a PixelCNN, we show that existing learning techniques typically fail to effectively use latent variables. To address this, we develop a modification of the Variational Autoencoder in which encoded observations are decoded to new elements from the same class. This technique, which we call a Variational Homoencoder (VHE), produces a hierarchical latent variable model which better utilises latent variables. We use the VHE framework to learn a hierarchical PixelCNN on the Omniglot dataset, which outperforms all existing models on test set likelihood and achieves strong performance on one-shot generation and classification tasks. We additionally validate the VHE on natural images from the YouTube Faces database. Finally, we develop extensions of the model that apply to richer dataset structures such as factorial and hierarchical categories.},

Our network allows configurations such that memory and compute requirements are drastically reduced, and a tradeoff analysis of accuracy and complexity is presented. The analysis shows high accuracy at significantly reduced computational complexity compared to existing solutions. For example, a configuration with only 155k parameters and 49:3 million multiply-adds per second is 81:75\%, exceeding human accuracy of 81:3\%.

This paper explores a number of predictors and searches for a predictor which has high accuracy and low computation complexity and power consumption. Many predictors from three different classes, including classic time series, artificial neural networks, and wavelet transform-based predictors, are compared. These predictors are evaluated using real network traces. Comparison of accuracy and cost, both in terms of computation complexity and power consumption, is presented. It is observed that a double exponential smoothing predictor provides a reasonable tradeoff between performance and cost overhead.},

  abstract = {The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (ESPPRC) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The ESPPRC often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). As the ESPPRC problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints (SPPRC), which can be solved using a pseudopolynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes unpractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving ESPPRC and SPPRC is to forbid cycles of small length. In the SPPRC with fc-cycle elimination (SPPRC-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k +1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i -j -i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k {$\geq$} 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard VRPTW instances from Solomon's benchmark show that fc-cycle elimination with k {$>$} 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints. The new algorithm has proven to be a key ingredient for getting exact integer solutions for well-known hard problems from the literature. \textcopyright{} 2006 INFORMS.},

Kluwer Academic, Boston, pp 57\textendash 93, 1998), is applicable to nearly all types of vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling problems found in the literature thus far. The framework utilizes resource extension functions (REFs) as its main tool for handling complex side constraints that relate to a single vehicle route or crew schedule. The intention of this paper is to clarify which properties of REFs allow important algorithmic procedures, such as efficient representation of (partial) paths, efficient cost computations, and constant time feasibility checking for partial paths (= segments) and their concatenations. The theoretical results provided by the paper are useful for developing highly efficient solution methods for both exact and heuristic approaches. Acceleration techniques for solving resource-constrained shortest-path subproblems are a key success factor for those exact algorithms which are based on column generation or Lagrangean relaxation. Similarly, those heuristic algorithms which are based on resource-constrained paths can benefit from efficient operations needed to construct or manipulate segments. Fast operations are indispensable for efficient local-search algorithms that explore edge-exchange or node-exchange neighborhoods. Efficiency is crucial, since these operations are repeatedly performed in many types of metaheuristics.},

A mathematical model and valid inequalities are presented. Furthermore, a new family of inequalities denoted the generalized capacity inequalities are introduced. Experimental results are performed on a set of benchmark instances generated from well known benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Until now, label algorithms have been the dominant solution method for this problem but experimental results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms on all the generated instances. Secondly, it can be concluded that although the generalized capacity inequalities drastically improves the lower bound the high separation time makes their usefulness questionable in their current form.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem (CPTP) which is a special case of the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints (ESPPRC). The CPTP belongs to the group of problems known as traveling salesman problems with profits. In CPTP each customer is associated with a profit and a demand and the objective is to find a capacitated tour (rooted in a depot node) that minimizes the total travel distance minus the profit of the visited customers. The CPTP can be recognized as the sub-problem in many column generation applications, where it is traditionally solved through dynamic programming. In this paper we present an alternative framework based on a formulation for the undirected CPTP and solved through branch-and-cut. Valid inequalities are presented among which we introduce a new family of inequalities for the CPTP denoted rounded multistar inequalities and we prove their validity. Computational experiments are performed on a set of instances known from the literature and a set of newly generated instances. The results indicate that the presented algorithm is highly competitive with the dynamic programming algorithms. In particular, we are able to solve instances with 800 nodes to optimality where the dynamic programming algorithms cannot solve instances with more than 200 nodes. Moreover dynamic programming and branch-and-cut complement each other well, giving us hope for solving more general problems through hybrid approaches. The paper is intended to serve as a platform for further development of branch-and-cut algorithms for CPTP hence also acting as a survey/tutorial.},

  abstract = {Random access schemes in modern wireless communications are generally based on the framed-ALOHA (f-ALOHA), which can be optimized by flexibly organizing devices' transmission and re-transmission. However, this optimization is generally intractable due to the lack of information about complex traffic generation statistics and the occurrence of the random collision. In this article, we first summarize the general structure of access control optimization for different random access schemes, and then review the existing access control optimization based on Machine Learning (ML) and non-ML techniques. We demonstrate that the ML-based methods can better optimize the access control problem compared with non-ML based methods, due to their capability in solving high complexity long-term optimization problem and learning experiential knowledge from reality. To further improve the random access performance, we propose two-step learning optimizers for access control optimization, which individually execute the traffic prediction and the access control configuration. In detail, our traffic prediction method relies on online supervised learning adopting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that can accurately capture traffic statistics over consecutive frames, and the access control configuration can use either a non-ML based controller or a cooperatively trained Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based controller depending on the complexity of different random access schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed two-step cooperative learning optimizer considerably outperforms the conventional Deep QNetwork (DQN) in terms of higher training efficiency and better access performance.},

  abstract = {Some Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication links particularly those in a industrial automation plant have stringent latency requirements. In this paper, we study the delay-performance for the M2M uplink from the sensors to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in a industrial automation scenario. The uplink traffic can be broadly classified as either Periodic Update (PU) and Event Driven (ED). The PU arrivals from different sensors are periodic, synchronized by the PLC and need to be processed by a prespecified firm latency deadline. On the other hand, the ED arrivals are random, have lowarrival rate, but may need to be processed quickly depending upon the criticality of the application. To accommodate these contrasting Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, we model the utility of PU and ED packets using step function and sigmoidal functions of latency respectively. Our goal is to maximize the overall system utility while being proportionally fair to both PU and ED data. To this end, we propose a novel online QoS-aware packet scheduler that gives priority to ED data as long as that results the latency deadline is met for PU data. However as the size of networks increases, we drop the PU packets that fail to meet latency deadline which reduces congestion and improves overall system utility. Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of our scheme with various scheduling policies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Earliest-Due-Date (EDD) and (preemptive) priority. We show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes for various simulation scenarios.},

We first describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for sound event detection and classification using weakly labeled audio data. Our model trains efficiently from audios of variable lengths; hence, it is well suited for transfer learning. We then propose methods to learn representations using this model which can be effectively used for solving the target task. We study both transductive and inductive transfer learning tasks, showing the effectiveness of our methods for both domain and task adaptation. We show that the learned representations using the proposed CNN model generalizes well enough to reach human level accuracy on ESC-50 sound events dataset and set state of art results on this dataset. We further use them for acoustic scene classification task and once again show that our proposed approaches suit well for this task as well. We also show that our methods are helpful in capturing semantic meanings and relations as well. Moreover, in this process we also set state-of-art results on Audioset dataset, relying on balanced training set.},

For speech emotion recognition tasks, generating effective features is crucial. Currently, handcrafted features are mostly used for speech emotion recognition, however, features learned automatically using deep learning have shown strong success in many problems, especially in image processing. In particular, deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained enormous success for generating features for natural images. Inspired by this, we propose VAEs for deriving the latent representation of speech signals and use this representation to classify emotions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose VAEs for speech emotion classification. Evaluations on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that features learned by VAEs can produce state-of-the-art results for speech emotion classification.},

  abstract = {Since the mobile boom has started to cause a traffic jam in mobile broadband networks, forecasts on future traffic needs are urgent information for the provision of high-quality mobile broadband services. Thus, this research aims to forecast mobile broadband traffic, focusing on the Korean case. With the emergence of diverse classes of services, where the available devices for the services and their patterns of use are changing rapidly, most of the existing forecasting methods may not be applicable. Therefore, this study designed a new methodology for traffic forecasts, a device-based forecasting that consider mobile traffic from various devices for mobile services. The proposed approach performs the three-round Delphi process to complement the experts' opinions in forecasting mobile traffic for 10 years. In particular, scenario analysis was applied to reflect uncertainty of future dynamic situations, investigating optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios. In addition, the forecasting performance of the suggested approach was validated by comparing it with that of traditional forecasting tools. The research findings indicate that mobile traffic will increase rapidly, and the patterns of use for mobile devices will change to some extent, which will provide strategic implications for both companies and government.},

Until now, there has not been a systematic study of how these formulations relate to each other. An exception is a paper of Luis Gouveia, which shows that a one-commodity flow formulation of Gavish and Graves yields, by projection, certain 'multistar' inequalities in the two-index space. We give a survey of formulations for the capacitated VRP, and then present various results of a similar flavour to those of Gouveia. In particular, we show that: - the three-index formulation, augmented by certain families of valid inequalities, gives the same lower bound as the two-index formulation, augmented by certain simpler families of valid inequalities, - the two-commodity flow formulation of Baldacci et al. gives the same lower bound and the same multistar inequalities as the one-commodity Gavish and Graves formulation, - a certain non-standard multi-commodity flow formulation, with one commodity per customer, implies by projection certain 'hypotour-like' inequalities in the two-index space, - the set partitioning formulation implies by projection both multistar and hypotour-like inequalities in the two-index space. We also briefly look at some other variants of the VRP, such as the VRP with time windows, and derive multistar-like inequalities for them. We also present polynomial-time separation algorithms for some of the new inequalities.},

  abstract = {An alternative pathway for the human brain to communicate with the outside world is by means of a brain computer interface (BCI). A BCI can decode electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the BCI depends on the performance in decoding the EEG. Usually, the EEG is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram (EMG), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the EEG contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the BCI cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the Lomb\^aScargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete EEG (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with motor imagery EEG data. The results show that our method can successfully decode incomplete EEG to good effect.},

  abstract = {In order to improve the prediction accuracy of network traffic, a novel prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition and multiple models is proposed. In this study, ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm is introduced to decompose the network traffic and get several components. Approximate entropy is introduced to judge the complexity of each component. According to the results of approximate entropy, echo state network is selected to predict high complexity components, support vector machine is used to predict medium complexity components, and autoregressive integrated moving average model is introduced to predict low complexity components. The advantages of each prediction model are used to predict the appropriate component. The final prediction results are obtained by adding the predicted values of each component. In order to solve the problem that the prediction performance of support vector machine and echo state network is affected by their parameters, an improved whale optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of the model. Meanwhile, the calculation results of approximate entropy show that compared with the original network traffic, the complexity of each component obtained by ensemble empirical mode decomposition is reduced, which reduces the complexity of modeling. Three network traffic datasets with sampling periods of 10 ms, 1 s, and 10 min are collected. Compared with the other five state-of-the-art prediction models, the case study results show that the proposed prediction model has better prediction accuracy and excellent statistical performance indicators.},

This is a flexible class of models which can describe serial correlation in a parsimonious way. The conditional mean of the process is linked to its past values, to past observations and to potential covariate effects. The package allows for models with the identity and with the logarithmic link function. The conditional distribution can be Poisson or negative binomial. An important special case of this class is the so-called INGARCH model and its log-linear extension. The package includes methods for model fitting and assessment, prediction and intervention analysis. This paper summarizes the theoretical background of these methods. It gives details on the implementation of the package and provides simulation results for models which have not been studied theoretically before. The usage of the package is illustrated by two data examples. Additionally, we provide a review of R packages which can be used for count time series analysis. This includes a detailed comparison of tscount to those packages.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a successful application of deep learning for object recognition based on acoustic data. The shortcomings of previously employed approaches where handcrafted features describing the acoustic data are being used, include limiting the capability of the found representation to be widely applicable and facing the risk of capturing only insignificant characteristics for a task. In contrast, there is no need to define the feature representation format when using multilayer/deep learning architecture methods: features can be learned from raw sensor data without defining discriminative characteristics a-priori. In this paper, stacked denoising autoencoders are applied to train a deep learning model. Knocking each object in our test set 120 times with a marker pen to obtain the auditory data, thirty different objects were successfully classified in our experiment and each object was knocked 120 times by a marker pen to obtain the auditory data. By employing the proposed deep learning framework, a high accuracy of 91.50\% was achieved. A traditional method using handcrafted features with a shallow classifier was taken as a benchmark and the attained recognition rate was only 58.22\%. Interestingly, a recognition rate of 82.00\% was achieved when using a shallow classifier with raw acoustic data as input. In addition, we could show that the time taken to classify one object using deep learning was far less ( by a factor of more than 6) than utilizing the traditional method. It was also explored how different model parameters in our deep architecture affect the recognition performance.},

The algorithm uses a variety of cutting planes, including capacity, framed capacity, generalized capacity, strengthened comb, multistar, partial multistar, extended hypotour inequalities, and classical Gomory mixed-integer cuts. For each of these classes of inequalities we describe our separation algorithms in detail. Also we describe the other important ingredients of our branch-and-cut algorithm, such as the branching rules, the node selection strategy, and the cut pool management. Computational results, for a large number of instances, show that the new algorithm is competitive. In particular, we solve three instances (B-n50-k8, B-n66-k9 and B-n78-k10) of Augerat to optimality for the first time. \textcopyright{} Springer-Verlag 2003.},

Here, we demonstrate the first deep network for acoustic recognition that is small enough for an off-the-shelf microcrocontroller, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Rather than handcrafting a once-off solution, we present a universal pipeline that converts a large deep convolutional network automatically via compression and quantization into a network for resource-impoverished edge devices. After introducing ACDNet, which produces above state-of-the-art accuracy on ESC-10 (96.65\%) and ESC-50 (87.1\%), we describe the compression pipeline and show that it allows us to achieve 97.22\% size reduction and 97.28\% FLOP reduction while maintaining close to state-of-the-art accuracy (83.65\% on ESC-50). We describe a successful implementation on a standard off-the-shelf microcontroller and, beyond laboratory benchmarks, report successful tests on real-world data sets.},

These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual ORSNZ Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage. We also make improvements to this algorithm and test them computationally. \textcopyright{} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, Vol. 53(4), 358-381 2009.},

In doing so, we leverage the knowledge that is contained in these neural networks to extract semantically rich features (representations) that serve as input to a Gaussian Mixture Model which is used as a density estimator to model normality. We compare feature extractors that were trained on data from various domains, namely: images, environmental sounds and music. Our approach is evaluated on recordings from factory machinery such as valves, pumps, sliders and fans. All of the evaluated representations outperform the autoencoder baseline with music based representations yielding the best performance in most cases. These results challenge the common assumption that closely matching the domain of the feature extractor and the downstream task results in better downstream task performance.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing problems are at the heart of most decision support systems for real-life distribution problems. In vehicle routing problem a set of routes must be determined at lowest total cost for a number of resources (i.e. fleet of vehicles) located at one or several points (e.g. depots, warehouses) to efficiently service a number of demand or supply points. In this paper a new memetic algorithm is suggested for the standard capacitated vehicle routing problem. The proposed algorithm combines the edge assembly (EAX) crossover with two well-known local searches and allows for infeasible solutions with respect to capacity constraint during the search. To address the constraint violation, an efficient modification algorithm is also suggested. Experimental tests on 32 standard benchmarks demonstrate that the suggested method is robust and competitive, finding the best-known solution to 28 problems and new best-known solution to 12 well-studied instances in a reasonable computing time.},

We classify IoT traffic into four classes: Fixed-Bit Periodic (FBP), Variable-Bit Periodic (VBP), Fixed-Bit Aperiodic (FBA), and Variable-Bit Aperiodic (VBA). We show that LSTM outperforms all of the other models significantly in the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) measure for devices in the VBP class in our simulations. Furthermore, we show that LSTM has almost the same performance in this metric for the FBA class as MLP and 1-D CNN. While the training time per IoT device is the highest for LSTM, all of the forecasting models have reasonable training times for practical implementation. Our results suggest an architecture in which an IoT Gateway predicts the future traffic of IoT devices in the FBP, VBP and FBA classes and pre-allocates the uplink wireless channel for these classes in advance in order to alleviate the Massive Access Problem of M2M communication.},

The specific animal audio classification problems are i) birds and ii) cat sounds, whose datasets are freely available. We train five different CNNs on the original datasets and on their versions augmented by four augmentation protocols, working on the raw audio signals or their representations as spectrograms. We compared our best approaches with the state of the art, showing that we obtain the best recognition rate on the same datasets, without ad hoc parameter optimization. Our study shows that different CNNs can be trained for the purpose of animal audio classification and that their fusion works better than the stand-alone classifiers. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest study on data augmentation for CNNs in animal audio classification audio datasets using the same set of classifiers and parameters.

  abstract = {Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.},

An identification procedure accepts as input the support graph of a point which does not belong to the polytope, and returns as output some of the facet inducing inequalities violated by the point. A procedure which always accomplishes this task is called exact, otherwise it is called heuristic. We give exact procedures for the subtour elimination and the 2-matching constraints, based on the Gomory-Hu and Padberg-Rao algorithms respectively. Efficient reduction procedures for the input graph are proposed which accelerate these two algorithms substantially. Exact and heuristic shrinking conditions for the input graph are also given that yield efficient procedures for the identification of simple and general comb inequalities and of some elementary clique tree inequalities. These procedures constitute the core of a polytopal cutting plane algorithm that we have devised and programmed to solve a substantial number of large-scale problem instances with sizes up to 2392 nodes to optimality. \textcopyright{} 1990 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.},

  abstract = {The best performing exact algorithms for the capacitated vehicle routing problem developed in the last 10 years are based in the combination of cut and column generation. Some authors only used cuts expressed over the variables of the original formulation, in order to keep the pricing subproblem relatively easy. Other authors could reduce the duality gaps by also using a restricted number of cuts over the master LP variables, stopping when the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. A particularly effective family of such cuts are the subset row cuts. This work introduces a technique for greatly reducing the impact on the pricing of these cuts, thus allowing much more cuts to be added. The newly proposed branch-cut-and-price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching. All the instances used for benchmarking exact algorithms, with up to 199 customers, were solved to optimality. Moreover, some larger instances with up to 360 customers, only considered before by heuristic methods, were solved too.},

  abstract = {We propose branch-cut-and-price algorithms for the classic bin packing problem and also for the following related problems: vector packing, variable sized bin packing, and variable sized bin packing with optional items. The algorithms are defined as models for VRPSolver, a generic solver for vehicle routing problems. In that way, a simple parameterization enables the use of several branch-cut-and-price advanced elements: automatic stabilization by smoothing, limited-memory rank-1 cuts, enumeration, hierarchical strong branching, and limited discrepancy search diving heuristics. As an original theoretical contribution, we prove that the branching over accumulated resource consumption (G\'elinas et al, Ann Oper Res 61(1):91\textendash 109, 1995) that does not increase the difficulty of the pricing subproblem is sufficient for those bin packing models. Extensive computational results on instances from the literature show that the VRPSolver models have a performance that is very robust over all those problems, being often superior to the existing exact algorithms on the hardest instances. Several instances could be solved to optimality for the first time.},

  abstract = {Major advances were recently obtained in the exact solution of vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price (BCP) algorithms for some of the most classical VRP variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a BCP solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of VRPs. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing VRP algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of ``packing set'' and ``elementarity set''. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-VRPs, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

The evaluation was performed in a live network, using a number of mobile phones to generate additional traffic load. One Node B, with different configurations, was used throughout the experiments. The main areas of impact are identified, and similar underlying mechanisms are later recognised through deployment of a commercial large-scale M2M application. The paper describes the key findings of the analysis of five test cases from the network performance aspect. It further associates perceived network behaviour with the end-user experience in terms of the average delays. At the end, a comparison with the observed impacts of a live M2M application is given, and the main issues highlighted, together with a discussion on possible solutions.

  abstract = {We consider the Vehicle Routing Problem, in which a fixed fleet of delivery vehicles of uniform capacity must service known customer demands for a single commodity from a common depot at minimum transit cost. This difficult combinatorial problem contains both the Bin Packing Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as special cases and conceptually lies at the intersection of these two well-studied problems. The capacity constraints of the integer programming formulation of this routing model provide the link between the underlying routing and packing structures. We describe a decomposition-based separation methodology for the capacity constraints that takes advantage of our ability to solve small instances of the TSP efficiently. Specifically, when standard procedures fail to separate a candidate point, we attempt to decompose it into a convex combination of TSP tours; if successful, the tours present in this decomposition are examined for violated capacity constraints; if not, the Farkas Theorem provides a hyperplane separating the point from the TSP polytope. We present some extensions of this basic concept and a general framework within which it can be applied to other combinatorial models. Computational results are given for an implementation within the parallel branch, cut, and price framework SYMPHONY.},

The proposed heuristic is composed of three phases: the construction of an initial partial solution, the insertion of a node from each non-visited node-subset, and a solution improvement phase. We show that the heuristic performs very well on 36 TSPLIB problems which have been solved to optimality by other researchers. We also propose some simple heuristics that can be used as basic blocks to construct more efficient composite heuristics.},

  abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks ). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

We address the optimization of the RCESPP and we present and compare three methods. The first method is a well-known exact dynamic-programming algorithm improved by new ideas, such as bidirectional search with resource-based bounding. The second method consists in a branch-and-bound algorithm, where lower bounds are computed by dynamic-programming with state-space relaxation; we show how bounded bidirectional search can be adapted to statespace relaxation and we present different branching strategies and their hybridization. The third method, called decremental state-space relaxation, is a new one; exact dynamic-programming and state-space relaxation are two special cases of this new method. The experimental comparison of the three methods is definitely favorable to decrement state-space relaxation. Computational results are given for different kinds of resources, arising from the capacitated vehicle-routing problem, the vehicle-routing problem with distribution and collection, and the vehicle-routing problem with capacities and time windows. \textcopyright{} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We propose a variant of the bidirectional label-correcting algorithm in which the labels are stored and extended according to the so-called bucket graph. This organization of labels helps to significantly decrease the number of dominance checks and the running time of the algorithm. We also show how the forward/backward route symmetry can be exploited and how to eliminate arcs from the bucket graph using reduced costs. The proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for vehicle routing instances with large vehicle capacity and/or with time window constraints. Computational experiments were performed on instances from the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem, including multidepot and site-dependent variants, on the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and on the ``nightmare'' instances of the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem. Significant improvements over the best algorithms in the literature were achieved, and many instances could be solved for the first time.},

  abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks require more elaborate design of medium access control (MAC) due to their higher complexity in system management. In many applications of M2M networking, the major traffic pattern consists of data collected from several source nodes to a sink through a unidirectional tree. Earlier prevalence of Carrier-Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) has continuously been being switched to Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA). The main drawback of CSMA is idle listening, which refers to the fact that the nodes have to unnecessarily wake up due to lack of schedule. Energy inefficiency of a network gets higher as the number of nodes committed to idle listening, which seriously limits the scalability of a network. Recent enhancement of hardware has been enabling sufficiently accurate synchronization while keeping energy consumption low enough, which mitigates the main drawback of TDMA. This paper proposes a TDMA-based MAC protocol that achieves higher energy efficiency in centralized M2M communications. As a TDMA-based protocol, the proposed protocol is fully scheduled and hence no idle listening occurs. Moreover, the protocol reduces the length of a multi-hop transaction which results in higher energy efficiency as well as lower latency. Simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol outperforms the conventional CSMA and other popular MAC schemes, in terms of energy consumption, delay, and packet delivery ratio (PDR).},

The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize timedomain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of \$4.53\$ comparable to a MOS of \$4.58\$ for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and \$F\_0\$ features. We further demonstrate that using a compact acoustic intermediate representation enables significant simplification of the WaveNet architecture.},

Spearman rank correlation and Kendall's tau are often used for measuring and testing association between two continuous or ordered categorical responses. However, the established statistical properties of these tests are only valid when each pair of responses are independent, where each sampling unit has only one pair of responses. When each sampling unit consists of a cluster of paired responses, the assumption of independent pairs is violated. In this article, we apply the within-cluster resampling technique to U-statistics to form new tests and rank-based correlation estimators for possibly tied clustered data. We develop large sample properties of the new proposed tests and estimators and evaluate their performance by simulations. The proposed methods are applied to a data set collected from a PET/CT imaging study for illustration.},

In computing a spectrogram, the STFT window size parameterizes the trade-off between time and frequency resolution. However, it is not yet known how this parameter affects the operation of the binary mask in terms of separation quality for real-world signals such as speech or music. Here, we demonstrate that the trade-off between time and frequency in the STFT, used to perform ideal binary mask separation, depends upon the types of source that are to be separated. In particular, we demonstrate that different window sizes are optimal for separating different combinations of speech and musical signals. Our findings have broad implications for machine audition and machine learning in general.},

Moreover, we developed a reactive mechanism that dynamically controls the dimension of the SP models when dealing with large size instances. The algorithm was extensively tested on benchmark instances of the following Vechicle Routing Problem (VRP) variants: (i) Capacitated VRP; (ii) Asymmetric VRP; (iii) Open VRP; (iv) VRP with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery; (v) VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery; (vi) Multi-depot VRP; (vii) Multi-depot VRP with Mixed Pickup and Delivery.

The goal of building SCC for a community is to live in the present, plan for the future, and remember the past. We argue that Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to provide a ubiquitous network of connected devices and smart sensors for SCC, and big data analytics has the potential to enable the move from IoT to real-time control desired for SCC.

  abstract = {Due to the fast increase of sensing data and quick response requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT) delivery network, the high speed transmission has emerged as an important issue. Assigning suitable channels in the wireless IoT delivery network is a basic guarantee of high speed transmission. However, the high dynamics of traffic load (TL) make the conventional fixed channel assignment algorithm ineffective. Recently, the software defined networking-based IoT (SDN-IoT) is proposed to improve the transmission quality. Besides this, the intelligent technique of deep learning is widely researched in high computational SDN. Hence, we first propose a novel deep learning-based TL prediction algorithm to forecast future TL and congestion in network. Then, a deep learning-based partially channel assignment algorithm is proposed to intelligently allocate channels to each link in the SDN-IoT network. Finally, we consider a deep learning-based prediction and partially overlapping channel assignment to propose a novel intelligent channel assignment algorithm, which can intelligently avoid potential congestion and quickly assign suitable channels in SDN-IoT. The simulation result demonstrates that our proposal significantly outperforms conventional channel assignment algorithms.},

  abstract = {In machine to machine (M2M) communication systems based on the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE), the machine type communication (MTC) devices compete in a random access channel (RACH) to access the network. An MTC device randomly chooses a preamble from a pool of preambles and transmits it during the RACH. The evolved node B (eNodeB) acknowledges the successful reception of a preamble if that preamble is transmitted by only one device. To reduce the burstiness of the connection requests in heavy traffic situations, access class barring (ACB) is proposed in the 3GPP standard. Using ACB, an MTC device postpones its request in a RACH with a probability p. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive ACB scheme for congestion control of bursty M2M traffic. The optimal value of the ACB depends on the total number of MTC devices competing in a RACH. To estimate this number, we derive a joint conditional probability distribution function (PDF) for the number of preambles selected by zero or one MTC device, conditioned on the number of MTC devices that passed the ACB check. We design a maximum likelihood estimator using this PDF. We use this estimation to dynamically adjust the ACB factor. To further improve our estimation, we use Kalman filtering based on the dynamics of the system. Numerical results show that the total service time for the proposed method is very close to the optimal case where the information of the number of MTC devices is given.},

Using cellular networks for providing M2M connectivity brings several advantages such as extended coverage, security, robust management, and lower deployment costs; however, coexistence with a large number of M2M devices is still an essential challenge in LTE-A networks, in part due to the difficulty in allowing simultaneous access. Although the random access procedure in LTE-A is adequate for human-to-human (H2H) communications, when M2M communications are involved congestion control is required. One of the congestion control schemes suggested by the 3GPP is Access Class Barring (ACB), which can reduce the number of simultaneous users contending for access. However, it is still not clear how to adapt ACB parameters in bursty and heavy-loaded scenarios, such as those that appear in M2M communications. We propose a dynamic ACB scheme in which an estimate of the current number of M2M devices in backoff state is used to adjust in real-time the barring rate parameter. We evaluate the key performance indicators (KPIs) of dynamic ACB in several scenarios with different degrees of traffic load and compare them with those of a static ACB with optimal parameters. We show that the dynamic ACB outperforms the static one offering shorter access delay and higher successful access probability, while its impact on H2H communications KPIs is negligible. Besides, our proposed scheme conforms with the LTE-A specification so that it can be included as a viable solution.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks. Deciding how to feed the training data is important for further performance improvement. We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning (BC learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of BC learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of the training data; BC learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that BC learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks, datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which BC learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition network (EnvNet-v2) and train it with BC learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.},

MFCCs have also been used to classify non-speech sounds for audio surveillance systems, even though MFCCs do not completely reflect the time-varying features of non-stationary non-speech signals. We introduce a new 2D-feature set, used with a feature extraction method based on the pitch range (PR) of non-speech sounds and the Autocorrelation Function. We compare the classification accuracies of the proposed features of this new method to MFCCs by using Support Vec- tor Machines (SVMs) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network classifiers. Non-speech environmental sounds: gunshot, glass breaking, scream, dog barking, rain, engine, and restaurant noise, were studied. The new feature set provides high accuracy rates when used as a classifier. Its usage with MFCCs significantly improves the accuracy rates of the given classifiers in the range of 4\% to 35\% depending on the classifier used, suggest- ing that both feature sets are complementary. SVM classifier using the Gaussian kernel provided the highest accuracy rates among the classifiers used in this study.

  abstract = {Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition as applied to an integer program is a specific form of problem reformulation that aims at providing a tighter linear programming relaxation bound. The reformulation gives rise to an integer master problem, whose typically large number of variables is dealt with implicitly by using an integer programming column generation procedure, also known as branch-and-price algorithm. There is a large class of integer programs that are well suited for this solution technique. In this paper, we propose to base the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of an integer program on the discretization of the integer polyhedron associated with a subsystem of constraints (as opposed to its convexification). This allows us to formulate the integrality restriction directly on the master variables and sets a theoretical framework for dealing with specific issues such as branching or the introduction of cutting planes in the master. We discuss specific branching schemes and their effect on the structure of the column generation subproblem. We give theoretical bounds on the complexity of the separation process and the extent of the modifications to the column generation subproblem. Our computational tests on the cutting stock problem and a generalisation-the cutting strip problem-show that, in practice, all fractional solutions can be eliminated using branching rules that preserve the tractability of the subproblem, but there is a trade-off between branching efficiency and subproblem tractability.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing attributes are extra characteristics and decisions that complement the academic problem formulations and aim to properly account for real-life application needs. Hundreds of methods have been introduced in recent years for specific attributes, but the development of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efficient and applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efficient general-purpose solver. The proposed Unified Hybrid Genetic Search metaheuristic relies on problem-independent unified local search, genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem specifics are confined to a limited part of the method and are addressed by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components, which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental operators to manage attribute specificities. Extensive computational experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not necessarily go against efficiency for these problem classes.},

  abstract = {Low power and long range machine-to-machine (M2M) communication techniques are expected to provide ubiquitous connections for the wireless devices. In this paper, three major low power and long range M2M solutions are surveyed. The first type of solutions is referred to as the low power wide area (LPWA) network. The design of the LPWA techniques features low cost, low data rate, long communication range, and low power consumption. The second type of solutions is the IEEE 802.11ah which features higher data rates using a wider bandwidth than the LPWA-based solutions. The third type of solutions is operated under the cellular network infrastructure. Based on the analysis of the pros and cons of the enabling technologies of the surveyed M2M solutions, as well as the corresponding deployment strategies, the gaps in knowledge are identified. The paper also presents a summary of the research directions for improving the performance of the surveyed low power and long range M2M communication technologies.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has been highly successful in data-intensive applications but is often hampered when the data set is small. Recently, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.},

These methods range from principal component analysis to artificial neural network based variational autoencoders. The states are sampled using a Monte-Carlo simulation above and below the critical temperature. We find that the predicted latent parameters correspond to the known order parameters. The latent representation of the states of the models in question are clustered, which makes it possible to identify phases without prior knowledge of their existence or the underlying Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we find that the reconstruction loss function can be used as a universal identifier for phase transitions.},

Furthermore, we apply mixup to ESC tasks and explore its impacts on classification performance and feature distribution. Experiments were conducted on UrbanSound8K, ESC-50 and ESC-10 datasets.

  abstract = {Frequently count time series exhibit overdispersion, but the opposite phenomenon of underdispersion is well documented in some situations, thus may be encountered in real applications. The INGARCH model is a popular tool for modeling time series of counts. The Poisson and negative binomial models can only deal with overdispersion, and the double Poisson and generalized Poisson models can treat both of them, but the latter two models have some shortcomings or limitations. The revived COM-Poisson distribution is flexible in modeling a wide range of overdispersion and underdispersion with only two parameters, while possessing properties that make it methodologically appealing and useful in practice, thus we introduce a new INGARCH model based on this distribution. We give an approximate condition for stationarity and expressions for mean, variance and autocorrelation function and test the accuracy of these expressions via simulations and real examples. We discuss the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the parameters of interest. In addition, we also try to find influences of different distributions on INGARCH models using three real data sets. The results show that the generalized Poisson and COM-Poisson models perform well in most cases and the COM-Poisson model is a powerful competitor compared with the generalized Poisson model.},
