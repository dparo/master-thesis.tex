The other extreme is the spartan denial of a need for a rich syntax [Minsky 1970].

The {HVRP} model considered in this paper contains as special cases: the Single Depot {CVRP}, all variants of the {HVRP} presented in the literature, the Site-Dependent Vehicle Routing Problem ({SDVRP}) and the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem ({MDVRP}). This paper presents an exact algorithm for the {HVRP} based on the set partitioning formulation. The exact algorithm uses three types of bounding procedures based on the {LP}-relaxation and on the Lagrangean relaxation of the mathematical formulation. The bounding procedures allow to reduce the number of variables of the formulation so that the resulting problem can be solved by an integer linear programming solver. Extensive computational results over the main instances from the literature of the different variants of {HVRPs}, {SDVRP} and {MDVRP} show that the proposed lower bound is superior to the ones presented in the literature and that the exact algorithm can solve, for the first time ever, several test instances of all problem types considered. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

An identification procedure accepts as input the support graph of a point which does not belong to the polytope, and returns as output some of the facet inducing inequalities violated by the point. A procedure which always accomplishes this task is called exact, otherwise it is called heuristic. We give exact procedures for the subtour elimination and the 2-matching constraints, based on the Gomory-Hu and Padberg-Rao algorithms respectively. Efficient reduction procedures for the input graph are proposed which accelerate these two algorithms substantially. Exact and heuristic shrinking conditions for the input graph are also given that yield efficient procedures for the identification of simple and general comb inequalities and of some elementary clique tree inequalities. These procedures constitute the core of a polytopal cutting plane algorithm that we have devised and programmed to solve a substantial number of large-scale problem instances with sizes up to 2392 nodes to optimality. © 1990 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.},

The algorithm computes a daily plan for a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles that depart from different depots and must visit a set of customers for delivery operations. In this rich vehicle-routing problem ({VRP}), we consider multiple capacities; time windows associated with depots and customers; incompatibility constraints between goods, depots, vehicles, and customers; maximum route length and duration; upper limits on the number of consecutive driving hours and compulsory drivers' rest periods; the possibility of skipping some customers and using express courier services instead of the given fleet to fulfill some orders; the option of splitting up the orders; and the possibility of open routes that do not terminate at depots. Moreover, the cost of each vehicle route is computed through a system of fees depending on the locations visited by the vehicle, the distance traveled, the vehicle load, and the number of stops along the route. We developed a column generation algorithm where the pricing problem is a particular resource-constrained elementary shortest-path problem, solved through a bounded bidirectional dynamic programming algorithm. We describe how to encode the cost function and the complicating constraints by an appropriate use of resources, and we present computational results on real instances obtained from the software company. © 2009 {INFORMS}.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem ({CPTP}) which is a special case of the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints ({ESPPRC}). The {CPTP} belongs to the group of problems known as traveling salesman problems with profits. In {CPTP} each customer is associated with a profit and a demand and the objective is to find a capacitated tour (rooted in a depot node) that minimizes the total travel distance minus the profit of the visited customers. The {CPTP} can be recognized as the sub-problem in many column generation applications, where it is traditionally solved through dynamic programming. In this paper we present an alternative framework based on a formulation for the undirected {CPTP} and solved through branch-and-cut. Valid inequalities are presented among which we introduce a new family of inequalities for the {CPTP} denoted rounded multistar inequalities and we prove their validity. Computational experiments are performed on a set of instances known from the literature and a set of newly generated instances. The results indicate that the presented algorithm is highly competitive with the dynamic programming algorithms. In particular, we are able to solve instances with 800 nodes to optimality where the dynamic programming algorithms cannot solve instances with more than 200 nodes. Moreover dynamic programming and branch-and-cut complement each other well, giving us hope for solving more general problems through hybrid approaches. The paper is intended to serve as a platform for further development of branch-and-cut algorithms for {CPTP} hence also acting as a survey/tutorial.},

	abstract = {The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({ESPPRC}) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The {ESPPRC} often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows ({VRPTW}). As the {ESPPRC} problem is {NP}-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({SPPRC}), which can be solved using a pseudopolynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes unpractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving {ESPPRC} and {SPPRC} is to forbid cycles of small length. In the {SPPRC} with fc-cycle elimination ({SPPRC}-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k +1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i -j -i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k ≥ 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard {VRPTW} instances from Solomon's benchmark show that fc-cycle elimination with k {\textbackslash}textgreater 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints. The new algorithm has proven to be a key ingredient for getting exact integer solutions for well-known hard problems from the literature. © 2006 {INFORMS}.},

	abstract = {The constrained shortest-path problem ({CSPP}) generalizes the standard shortest-path problem by adding one or more path-weight side constraints. We present a new algorithm for {CSPP} that Lagrangianizes those constraints, optimizes the resulting Lagrangian function, identifies a feasible solution, and then closes any optimality gap by enumerating near-shortest paths, measured with respect to the Lagrangianized length. "Near-shortest" implies ϵ-optimal, with a varying ϵ that equals the current optimality gap. The algorithm exploits a variety of techniques: a new path-enumeration method; aggregated constraints; preprocessing to eliminate edges that cannot form part of an optimal solution; "reprocessing" that reapplies preprocessing steps as improved solutions are found; and, when needed, a "phase-I procedure" to identify a feasible solution before searching for an optimal one. The new algorithm is often an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm on singly constrained randomly generated grid networks. On multiconstrained grid networks, road networks, and networks for aircraft routing the advantage varies but, overall, the new algorithm is competitive with the label-setting algorithm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Firms in the durable goods industry occasionally launch trade-in or buyback campaigns to induce replacement purchases by customers. As a result of this, used products (cores) quickly accumulate at the dealers during the campaign periods. We study the reverse logistics problem of such a firm that aims to collect cores from its dealers. Having already established a number of collection centers where inspection of the cores can be performed, the firm's objective is to optimize the routes of a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles each of which will depart from a collection center, visit a number of dealers to pick up cores, and return to the same center. We assume that dealers do not give their cores back free of charge, but they have a reservation price. Therefore, the cores accumulating at a dealer can only be taken back if the acquisition price announced by the firm exceeds the dealer's reservation price. However, the firm is not obliged to visit all dealers; vehicles are dispatched to a dealer only if it is profitable to do so. The problem we focus on becomes an extension of the classical multi-depot vehicle routing problem ({MDVRP}) in which each visit to a dealer is associated with a gross profit and an acquisition price to be paid to take the cores back. We formulate two mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) models for this problem which we refer to as the selective {MDVRP} with pricing. Since the problem is {NP}-hard, we propose a Tabu Search based heuristic method to solve medium and large-sized instances. The performance of the heuristic is quite promising in comparison with solving the {MILP} models by a state-of-the-art commercial solver. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Sophisticated branch-cut-and-price ({BCP}) algorithms for some of the most classical {VRP} variants now solve many instances with up to a few hundreds of customers. However, adapting and reimplementing those successful algorithms for other variants can be a very demanding task. This work proposes a {BCP} solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of {VRPs}. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing {VRP} algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of “packing set” and “elementarity set”. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-{VRPs}, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the {ESPPRC}, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem.

The method consists in combining different dual ascent procedures to find a near optimal dual solution of the {SP} model. Then, a column-and-cut generation algorithm attempts to close the integrality gap left by the dual ascent procedures by adding valid inequalities to the {SP} formulation. The final dual solution is used to generate a reduced problem containing all optimal integer solutions that is solved by an integer programming solver. In this paper, we describe how this solution framework can be extended to solve different variants of the {VRP} by tailoring the different bounding procedures to deal with the constraints of the specific variant. We describe how this solution framework has been recently used to derive exact algorithms for a broad class of {VRPs} such as the capacitated {VRP}, the {VRP} with time windows, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, all types of heterogeneous {VRP} including the multi depot {VRP}, and the period {VRP}.

We give a survey of formulations for the capacitated {VRP}, and then present various results of a similar flavour to those of Gouveia. In particular, we show that: - the three-index formulation, augmented by certain families of valid inequalities, gives the same lower bound as the two-index formulation, augmented by certain simpler families of valid inequalities, - the two-commodity flow formulation of Baldacci et al. gives the same lower bound and the same multistar inequalities as the one-commodity Gavish and Graves formulation, - a certain non-standard multi-commodity flow formulation, with one commodity per customer, implies by projection certain 'hypotour-like' inequalities in the two-index space, - the set partitioning formulation implies by projection both multistar and hypotour-like inequalities in the two-index space. We also briefly look at some other variants of the {VRP}, such as the {VRP} with time windows, and derive multistar-like inequalities for them.

We propose a mathematical formulation of the problem and introduce valid inequalities to strengthen the corresponding continuous relaxation. Moreover, we provide an aggregate formulation that allows us to introduce further inequalities. Then, we propose a two–phase exact algorithm for the solution of the {UCGRPP}. In the first phase, a branch-and-cut algorithm is used to solve the aggregate formulation and to identify a cut pool of aggregate valid inequalities to be used in the second phase, where a branch-and-cut algorithm is implemented to optimally solve the {UCGRPP}. Computational results on a large set of problem instances show that the use of the aggregate formulation is effective, making the two-phase exact algorithm able to optimally solve a large number of instances.},

The algorithms are defined as models for {VRPSolver}, a generic solver for vehicle routing problems. In that way, a simple parameterization enables the use of several branch-cut-and-price advanced elements: automatic stabilization by smoothing, limited-memory rank-1 cuts, enumeration, hierarchical strong branching, and limited discrepancy search diving heuristics. As an original theoretical contribution, we prove that the branching over accumulated resource consumption (Gélinas et al, Ann Oper Res 61(1):91–109, 1995) that does not increase the difficulty of the pricing subproblem is sufficient for those bin packing models. Extensive computational results on instances from the literature show that the {VRPSolver} models have a performance that is very robust over all those problems, being often superior to the existing exact algorithms on the hardest instances. Several instances could be solved to optimality for the first time.},

These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual {ORSNZ} Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage.

The proposed algorithm can be especially beneficial for vehicle routing instances with large vehicle capacity and/or with time window constraints. Computational experiments were performed on instances from the distance-constrained vehicle routing problem, including multidepot and site-dependent variants, on the vehicle routing problem with time windows, and on the “nightmare” instances of the heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem.

In this paper, we model the M-{RRVRP} as a time constrained vehicle routing problem on a multigraph ({TVRP}-{MG}). We then formulate the {TVRP}-{MG} as a set partitioning problem with an additional constraint and describe an exact method for solving the {TVRP}-{MG}. This exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the formulation of the problem. Further, we obtain a valid upper bound and show how this bounding procedure can transform the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. Our computational results show that the proposed method is very effective in deriving an optimal or near optimal solution to the M-{RRVRP} in a reasonable amount of computing time. Since the capacitated vehicle routing problem ({CVRP}) can be transformed into a {TVRP}-{MG}, we tested our procedure on 11 instances of the {CVRP}. Our computational results show that our procedure very effectively found the optimal solution to 7 of the 11 instances of the {CVRP}.

	abstract = {We introduce the generalized elementary shortest path problem ({GESPP}) where in addition to the features of the shortest path problem, nodes belong to predefined non-disjoint clusters. Each cluster is associated to a profit to the cost function, obtained if at least one element in the cluster appears in the path. Several applications can be considered as school bus routing, pricing problems, or telecommunication network design. Thus, depending on the case, clusters could be interpreted as groups of nodes with linking features as, for example, being easily reachable from each other, or some kind of coverage guarantee. We compare the {GESPP} to similar problems in the literature and we propose a two-phase heuristic algorithm for graphs including negative cycles. Tests on random instances with up to 100 nodes show an average gap of 0.3\% to the best known solutions computed in 2.8s in average. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present ensembles of classifiers for automated animal audio classification, exploiting different data augmentation techniques for training Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). The specific animal audio classification problems are i) birds and ii) cat sounds, whose datasets are freely available. We train five different {CNNs} on the original datasets and on their versions augmented by four augmentation protocols, working on the raw audio signals or their representations as spectrograms. We compared our best approaches with the state of the art, showing that we obtain the best recognition rate on the same datasets, without ad hoc parameter optimization. Our study shows that different {CNNs} can be trained for the purpose of animal audio classification and that their fusion works better than the stand-alone classifiers. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest study on data augmentation for {CNNs} in animal audio classification audio datasets using the same set of classifiers and parameters. Our {MATLAB} code is available at https://github.com/{LorisNanni}.},

They work very well for the classifi- cation of speech and music signals. {MFCCs} have also been used to classify non-speech sounds for audio surveillance systems, even though {MFCCs} do not completely reflect the time-varying features of non-stationary non-speech signals. We introduce a new 2D-feature set, used with a feature extraction method based on the pitch range ({PR}) of non-speech sounds and the Autocorrelation Function. We compare the classification accuracies of the proposed features of this new method to {MFCCs} by using Support Vec- tor Machines ({SVMs}) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network classifiers. Non-speech environmental sounds: gunshot, glass breaking, scream, dog barking, rain, engine, and restaurant noise, were studied. The new feature set provides high accuracy rates when used as a classifier. Its usage with {MFCCs} significantly improves the accuracy rates of the given classifiers in the range of 4\% to 35\% depending on the classifier used, suggest- ing that both feature sets are complementary. {SVM} classifier using the Gaussian kernel provided the highest accuracy rates among the classifiers used in this study.

In addition, a technique for detecting the beat attributes of music is presented. Both synthetic and real world stimuli were used to evaluate the performance of the beat detection algorithm.},

In doing so, we leverage the knowledge that is contained in these neural networks to extract semantically rich features (representations) that serve as input to a Gaussian Mixture Model which is used as a density estimator to model normality. We compare feature extractors that were trained on data from various domains, namely: images, environmental sounds and music. Our approach is evaluated on recordings from factory machinery such as valves, pumps, sliders and fans. All of the evaluated representations outperform the autoencoder baseline with music based representations yielding the best performance in most cases. These results challenge the common assumption that closely matching the domain of the feature extractor and the downstream task results in better downstream task performance.},

We prove that for every n⩾2 there is an instance of {ATSP} ({STSP}) on n vertices for which {GR} finds the worst tour. The same result holds for {NN}. We also analyze the repetitive {NN} ({RNN}) that starts {NN} from every vertex and chooses the best tour obtained. We prove that, for the {ATSP}, {RNN} always produces a tour, which is not worse than at least n/2−1 other tours, but for some instance it finds a tour, which is not worse than at most n−2 other tours, n⩾4. We also show that, for some instance of the {STSP} on n⩾4 vertices, {RNN} produces a tour not worse than at most 2n−3 tours. These results are in sharp contrast to earlier results by Gutin and Yeo, and Punnen and Kabadi, who proved that, for the {ATSP}, there are tour construction heuristics, including some popular ones, that always build a tour not worse than at least (n−2)! tours.},

We show that the heuristic performs very well on 36 {TSPLIB} problems which have been solved to optimality by other researchers. We also propose some simple heuristics that can be used as basic blocks to construct more efficient composite heuristics.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) have been widely adopted as the main building block for end-to-end audio classification models, which aim to learn a direct mapping from audio spectrograms to corresponding labels. To better capture long-range global context, a recent trend is to add a self-attention mechanism on top of the {CNN}, forming a {CNN}-attention hybrid model. However, it is unclear whether the reliance on a {CNN} is necessary, and if neural networks purely based on attention are sufficient to obtain good performance in audio classification. In this paper, we answer the question by introducing the Audio Spectrogram Transformer ({AST}), the first convolution-free, purely attention-based model for audio classification. We evaluate {AST} on various audio classification benchmarks, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results of 0.485 {mAP} on {AudioSet}, 95.6\% accuracy on {ESC}-50, and 98.1\% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.},

In computing a spectrogram, the {STFT} window size parameterizes the trade-off between time and frequency resolution. However, it is not yet known how this parameter affects the operation of the binary mask in terms of separation quality for real-world signals such as speech or music. Here, we demonstrate that the trade-off between time and frequency in the {STFT}, used to perform ideal binary mask separation, depends upon the types of source that are to be separated. In particular, we demonstrate that different window sizes are optimal for separating different combinations of speech and musical signals. Our findings have broad implications for machine audition and machine learning in general.},

We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning ({BC} learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of {BC} learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of the training data; {BC} learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that {BC} learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks, datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which {BC} learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition network ({EnvNet}-v2) and train it with {BC} learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.},

We use as many {CDAEs} as the number of sources to be separated from the mixed signal. Each {CDAE} is trained to separate one source and treats the other sources as background noise. The main idea is to allow each {CDAE} to learn suitable spectral-temporal filters and features to its corresponding source.

	abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian methods can unify many related tasks (e.g. k-shot classification, conditional and unconditional generation) as inference within a single generative model. However, when this generative model is expressed as a powerful neural network such as a {PixelCNN}, we show that existing learning techniques typically fail to effectively use latent variables. To address this, we develop a modification of the Variational Autoencoder in which encoded observations are decoded to new elements from the same class. This technique, which we call a Variational Homoencoder ({VHE}), produces a hierarchical latent variable model which better utilises latent variables. We use the {VHE} framework to learn a hierarchical {PixelCNN} on the Omniglot dataset, which outperforms all existing models on test set likelihood and achieves strong performance on one-shot generation and classification tasks. We additionally validate the {VHE} on natural images from the {YouTube} Faces database. Finally, we develop extensions of the model that apply to richer dataset structures such as factorial and hierarchical categories.},

	title = {{DrumGAN}: Synthesis of Drum Sounds With Timbral Feature Conditioning Using Generative Adversarial Networks},
	abstract = {Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.},

	abstract = {Learning the latent representation of data in unsupervised fashion is a very interesting process that provides relevant features for enhancing the performance of a classifier. For speech emotion recognition tasks, generating effective features is crucial. Currently, handcrafted features are mostly used for speech emotion recognition, however, features learned automatically using deep learning have shown strong success in many problems, especially in image processing. In particular, deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders ({VAEs}) have gained enormous success for generating features for natural images. Inspired by this, we propose {VAEs} for deriving the latent representation of speech signals and use this representation to classify emotions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose {VAEs} for speech emotion classification. Evaluations on the {IEMOCAP} dataset demonstrate that features learned by {VAEs} can produce state-of-the-art results for speech emotion classification.},

While long-range dependencies are difficult to model directly in the time domain, we show that they can be more tractably modelled in two-dimensional time-frequency representations such as spectrograms. By leveraging this representational advantage, in conjunction with a highly expressive probabilistic model and a multiscale generation procedure, we design a model capable of generating high-fidelity audio samples which capture structure at timescales that time-domain models have yet to achieve. We apply our model to a variety of audio generation tasks, including unconditional speech generation, music generation, and text-to-speech synthesis—showing improvements over previous approaches in both density estimates and human judgments.},

We then propose methods to learn representations using this model which can be effectively used for solving the target task. We study both transductive and inductive transfer learning tasks, showing the effectiveness of our methods for both domain and task adaptation. We show that the learned representations using the proposed {CNN} model generalizes well enough to reach human level accuracy on {ESC}-50 sound events dataset and set state of art results on this dataset. We further use them for acoustic scene classification task and once again show that our proposed approaches suit well for this task as well. We also show that our methods are helpful in capturing semantic meanings and relations as well. Moreover, in this process we also set state-of-art results on Audioset dataset, relying on balanced training set.},

Recently, Few-Shot Learning ({FSL}) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, {FSL} can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand {FSL}. Starting from a formal definition of {FSL}, we distinguish {FSL} from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in {FSL} is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize {FSL} methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the {FSL} problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.},

These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with very attractive real world applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection ({STD}). In this {STD} application, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the conventional Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) based approaches at significantly lower computation requirements. We propose unsupervised learning of Audio Word2Vec from audio data without human annotation using Sequence-to-sequence Audoencoder ({SA}). {SA} consists of two {RNNs} equipped with Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) units: the first {RNN} (encoder) maps the input audio sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second {RNN} (decoder) maps the representation back to the input audio sequence. The two {RNNs} are jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder ({DSA}) is furthered proposed offering more robust learning.},

	abstract = {Model building in machine learning is an iterative process. The performance analysis and debugging step typically involves a disruptive cognitive switch from model building to error analysis, discouraging an informed approach to model building. We present {ModelTracker}, an interactive visualization that subsumes information contained in numerous traditional summary statistics and graphs while displaying example-level performance and enabling direct error examination and debugging. Usage analysis from machine learning practitioners building real models with {ModelTracker} over six months shows {ModelTracker} is used often and throughout model building. A controlled experiment focusing on {ModelTracker}'s debugging capabilities shows participants prefer {ModelTracker} over traditional tools without a loss in model performance.},

	title = {"Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier},
	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks ). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding – and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures – we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets ({CIFAR}-10, {CIFAR}-100, {ImageNet}). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by {CNNs}, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

	title = {Debugging Machine Learning Tasks},
	abstract = {Unlike traditional programs (such as operating systems or word processors) which have large amounts of code, machine learning tasks use programs with relatively small amounts of code (written in machine learning libraries), but voluminous amounts of data. Just like developers of traditional programs debug errors in their code, developers of machine learning tasks debug and fix errors in their data. However, algorithms and tools for debugging and fixing errors in data are less common, when compared to their counterparts for detecting and fixing errors in code. In this paper, we consider classification tasks where errors in training data lead to misclassifications in test points, and propose an automated method to find the root causes of such misclassifications. Our root cause analysis is based on Pearl's theory of causation, and uses Pearl's {PS} (Probability of Sufficiency) as a scoring metric. Our implementation, Psi, encodes the computation of {PS} as a probabilistic program, and uses recent work on probabilistic programs and transformations on probabilistic programs (along with gray-box models of machine learning algorithms) to efficiently compute {PS}. Psi is able to identify root causes of data errors in interesting data sets.},

	abstract = {An alternative pathway for the human brain to communicate with the outside world is by means of a brain computer interface ({BCI}). A {BCI} can decode electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the {BCI} depends on the performance in decoding the {EEG}. Usually, the {EEG} is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram ({EMG}), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the {EEG} contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the {BCI} cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the LombâScargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete {EEG} (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder ({DAE}) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with motor imagery {EEG} data. The results show that our method can successfully decode incomplete {EEG} to good effect.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a successful application of deep learning for object recognition based on acoustic data. The shortcomings of previously employed approaches where handcrafted features describing the acoustic data are being used, include limiting the capability of the found representation to be widely applicable and facing the risk of capturing only insignificant characteristics for a task. In contrast, there is no need to define the feature representation format when using multilayer/deep learning architecture methods: features can be learned from raw sensor data without defining discriminative characteristics a-priori. In this paper, stacked denoising autoencoders are applied to train a deep learning model. Knocking each object in our test set 120 times with a marker pen to obtain the auditory data, thirty different objects were successfully classified in our experiment and each object was knocked 120 times by a marker pen to obtain the auditory data. By employing the proposed deep learning framework, a high accuracy of 91.50\% was achieved. A traditional method using handcrafted features with a shallow classifier was taken as a benchmark and the attained recognition rate was only 58.22\%. Interestingly, a recognition rate of 82.00\% was achieved when using a shallow classifier with raw acoustic data as input. In addition, we could show that the time taken to classify one object using deep learning was far less ( by a factor of more than 6) than utilizing the traditional method. It was also explored how different model parameters in our deep architecture affect the recognition performance.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the Capacitated Profitable Tour Problem ({CPTP}) which is a special case of the Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Resource Constraints ({ESPPRC}). The {CPTP} belongs to the group of problems known as traveling salesman problems with profits. In {CPTP} each customer is associated with a profit and a demand and the objective is to find a capacitated tour (rooted in a depot node) that minimizes the total travel distance minus the profit of the visited customers. The {CPTP} can be recognized as the sub-problem in many column generation applications, where it is traditionally solved through dynamic programming. In this paper we present an alternative framework based on a formulation for the undirected {CPTP} and solved through branch-and-cut. Valid inequalities are presented among which we introduce a new family of inequalities for the {CPTP} denoted rounded multistar inequalities and we prove their validity. Computational experiments are performed on a set of instances known from the literature and a set of newly generated instances. The results indicate that the presented algorithm is highly competitive with the dynamic programming algorithms. In particular, we are able to solve instances with 800 nodes to optimality where the dynamic programming algorithms cannot solve instances with more than 200 nodes. Moreover dynamic programming and branch-and-cut complement each other well, giving us hope for solving more general problems through hybrid approaches. The paper is intended to serve as a platform for further development of branch-and-cut algorithms for {CPTP} hence also acting as a survey/tutorial.},

We introduce a new route relaxation called ng-route, used by different dual ascent heuristics to find near-optimal dual solutions of the {LP}-relaxation of the {SP} model. We describe a column-and-cut generation algorithm strengthened by valid inequalities that uses a new strategy for solving the pricing problem. The new ng-route relaxation and the different dual solutions achieved allow us to generate a reduced {SP} problem containing all routes of any optimal solution that is finally solved by an integer programming solver.

A mathematical model and valid inequalities are presented. Furthermore, a new family of inequalities denoted the generalized capacity inequalities are introduced. Experimental results are performed on a set of benchmark instances generated from well known benchmark instances for the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Until now, label algorithms have been the dominant solution method for this problem but experimental results show that the branch-and-cut algorithm clearly outperforms on all the generated instances. Secondly, it can be concluded that although the generalized capacity inequalities drastically improves the lower bound the high separation time makes their usefulness questionable in their current form.},

	abstract = {The constrained shortest-path problem ({CSPP}) generalizes the standard shortest-path problem by adding one or more path-weight side constraints. We present a new algorithm for {CSPP} that Lagrangianizes those constraints, optimizes the resulting Lagrangian function, identifies a feasible solution, and then closes any optimality gap by enumerating near-shortest paths, measured with respect to the Lagrangianized length. "Near-shortest" implies ε-optimal, with a varying ε that equals the current optimality gap. The algorithm exploits a variety of techniques: a new path-enumeration method; aggregated constraints; preprocessing to eliminate edges that cannot form part of an optimal solution; "reprocessing" that reapplies preprocessing steps as improved solutions are found; and, when needed, a "phase-I procedure" to identify a feasible solution before searching for an optimal one. The new algorithm is often an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art label-setting algorithm on singly constrained randomly generated grid networks. On multiconstrained grid networks, road networks, and networks for aircraft routing the advantage varies but, overall, the new algorithm is competitive with the label-setting algorithm. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual {ORSNZ} Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage.

A relaxed version of this problem in which the path does not have to be elementary has been the backbone of a number of solution procedures based on column generation for several important problems, such as vehicle routing and crew pairing. In many cases relaxing the restriction of an elementary path resulted in optimal solutions in a reasonable computation time. However, for a number of other problems, the elementary path restriction has too much impact on the solution to be relaxed or might even be necessary. We propose an exact solution procedure for the {ESPPRC}, which extends the classical label correcting algorithm originally developed for the relaxed (nonelementary) path version of this problem.

An exception is a paper of Luis Gouveia, which shows that a one-commodity flow formulation of Gavish and Graves yields, by projection, certain 'multistar' inequalities in the two-index space. We give a survey of formulations for the capacitated {VRP}, and then present various results of a similar flavour to those of Gouveia. In particular, we show that: - the three-index formulation, augmented by certain families of valid inequalities, gives the same lower bound as the two-index formulation, augmented by certain simpler families of valid inequalities, - the two-commodity flow formulation of Baldacci et al. gives the same lower bound and the same multistar inequalities as the one-commodity Gavish and Graves formulation, - a certain non-standard multi-commodity flow formulation, with one commodity per customer, implies by projection certain 'hypotour-like' inequalities in the two-index space, - the set partitioning formulation implies by projection both multistar and hypotour-like inequalities in the two-index space. We also briefly look at some other variants of the {VRP}, such as the {VRP} with time windows, and derive multistar-like inequalities for them.

The number of customers visited and assigned to a ring is bounded by an upper limit: the capacity of the ring. The objective is to minimize the total routing cost plus assignment costs. The problem has practical applications in the design of urban optical telecommunication networks. This paper presents and discusses two integer programming formulations for the {CmRSP}. Valid inequalities are proposed to strengthen the linear programming relaxation and are used as cutting planes in a branch-and-cut approach.

An identification procedure accepts as input the support graph of a point which does not belong to the polytope, and returns as output some of the facet inducing inequalities violated by the point. A procedure which always accomplishes this task is called exact, otherwise it is called heuristic. We give exact procedures for the subtour elimination and the 2-matching constraints, based on the Gomory-Hu and Padberg-Rao algorithms respectively. Efficient reduction procedures for the input graph are proposed which accelerate these two algorithms substantially. Exact and heuristic shrinking conditions for the input graph are also given that yield efficient procedures for the identification of simple and general comb inequalities and of some elementary clique tree inequalities. These procedures constitute the core of a polytopal cutting plane algorithm that we have devised and programmed to solve a substantial number of large-scale problem instances with sizes up to 2392 nodes to optimality. © 1990 The Mathematical Programming Society, Inc.},

In this paper, we model the M-{RRVRP} as a time constrained vehicle routing problem on a multigraph ({TVRP}-{MG}). We then formulate the {TVRP}-{MG} as a set partitioning problem with an additional constraint and describe an exact method for solving the {TVRP}-{MG}. This exact method is based on a bounding procedure that combines three lower bounds derived from different relaxations of the formulation of the problem. Further, we obtain a valid upper bound and show how this bounding procedure can transform the solution of a Lagrangean lower bound into a feasible solution. Our computational results show that the proposed method is very effective in deriving an optimal or near optimal solution to the M-{RRVRP} in a reasonable amount of computing time. Since the capacitated vehicle routing problem ({CVRP}) can be transformed into a {TVRP}-{MG}, we tested our procedure on 11 instances of the {CVRP}. Our computational results show that our procedure very effectively found the optimal solution to 7 of the 11 instances of the {CVRP}.

	abstract = {Firms in the durable goods industry occasionally launch trade-in or buyback campaigns to induce replacement purchases by customers. As a result of this, used products (cores) quickly accumulate at the dealers during the campaign periods. We study the reverse logistics problem of such a firm that aims to collect cores from its dealers. Having already established a number of collection centers where inspection of the cores can be performed, the firm's objective is to optimize the routes of a homogeneous fleet of capacitated vehicles each of which will depart from a collection center, visit a number of dealers to pick up cores, and return to the same center. We assume that dealers do not give their cores back free of charge, but they have a reservation price. Therefore, the cores accumulating at a dealer can only be taken back if the acquisition price announced by the firm exceeds the dealer's reservation price. However, the firm is not obliged to visit all dealers; vehicles are dispatched to a dealer only if it is profitable to do so. The problem we focus on becomes an extension of the classical multi-depot vehicle routing problem ({MDVRP}) in which each visit to a dealer is associated with a gross profit and an acquisition price to be paid to take the cores back. We formulate two mixed-integer linear programming ({MILP}) models for this problem which we refer to as the selective {MDVRP} with pricing. Since the problem is {NP}-hard, we propose a Tabu Search based heuristic method to solve medium and large-sized instances. The performance of the heuristic is quite promising in comparison with solving the {MILP} models by a state-of-the-art commercial solver. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The elementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({ESPPRC}) is a widely used modeling tool in formulating vehicle-routing and crew-scheduling applications. The {ESPPRC} often occurs as a subproblem of an enclosing problem, where it is used to generate implicitly the set of all feasible routes or schedules, as in the column-generation formulation of the vehicle-routing problem with time windows ({VRPTW}). As the {ESPPRC} problem is {NP}-hard in the strong sense, classical solution approaches are based on the corresponding nonelementary shortest-path problem with resource constraints ({SPPRC}), which can be solved using a pseudopolynomial labeling algorithm. While solving the enclosing problem by branch and price, this subproblem relaxation leads to weak lower bounds and sometimes unpractically large branch-and-bound trees. A compromise between solving {ESPPRC} and {SPPRC} is to forbid cycles of small length. In the {SPPRC} with fc-cycle elimination ({SPPRC}-k-cyc), paths with cycles are allowed only if cycles have length at least k +1. The case k = 2 forbids sequences of the form i -j -i and has been successfully used to reduce integrality gaps. We propose a new definition of the dominance rule among labels for dealing with arbitrary values of k ≥ 2. The numerical experiments on the linear relaxation of some hard {VRPTW} instances from Solomon's benchmark show that fc-cycle elimination with k {\textgreater} 3 can substantially improve the lower bounds of vehicle-routing problems with side constraints.

This work proposes a {BCP} solver for a generic model that encompasses a wide class of {VRPs}. It incorporates the key elements found in the best existing {VRP} algorithms: ng-path relaxation, rank-1 cuts with limited memory, path enumeration, and rounded capacity cuts; all generalized through the new concepts of “packing set” and “elementarity set”. The concepts are also used to derive a branching rule based on accumulated resource consumption and to generalize the Ryan and Foster branching rule. Extensive experiments on several variants show that the generic solver has an excellent overall performance, in many problems being better than the best specific algorithms. Even some non-{VRPs}, like bin packing, vector packing and generalized assignment, can be modeled and effectively solved.},

In that way, a simple parameterization enables the use of several branch-cut-and-price advanced elements: automatic stabilization by smoothing, limited-memory rank-1 cuts, enumeration, hierarchical strong branching, and limited discrepancy search diving heuristics. As an original theoretical contribution, we prove that the branching over accumulated resource consumption (Gélinas et al, Ann Oper Res 61(1):91–109, 1995) that does not increase the difficulty of the pricing subproblem is sufficient for those bin packing models.

	abstract = {Vehicle routing problems ({VRPs}) are among the most studied problems in operations research. Nowadays, the leading exact algorithms for solving many classes of {VRPs} are branch-price-and-cut algorithms. In this survey paper, we highlight the main methodological and modeling contributions made over the years on branch-and-price (branch-price-and-cut) algorithms for {VRPs}, whether they are generic or specific to a {VRP} variant. We focus on problems related to the classical {VRP}—that is, problems in which customers must be served by several capacitated trucks and which are not combinations of a {VRP} and another optimization problem.},

We describe two new bounding procedures for {CVRP}, based on the so-called additive approach. Each procedure computes a sequence of nondecreasing lower bounds, obtained by solving different relaxations of {CVRP}. Effective implementation of the procedures are also outlined which considerably reduce the computational effort. The two procedures are combined into an overall bounding algorithm. A branch-and-bound exact algorithm is then proposed, whose performance is enhanced by means of reduction procedures, dominance criteria, and feasibility checks. Extensive computational results on both real-world and random test problems are presented, showing that the proposed approach favorably compares with previous algorithms from the literature.},

	abstract = {Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition as applied to an integer program is a specific form of problem reformulation that aims at providing a tighter linear programming relaxation bound. The reformulation gives rise to an integer master problem, whose typically large number of variables is dealt with implicitly by using an integer programming column generation procedure, also known as branch-and-price algorithm. There is a large class of integer programs that are well suited for this solution technique. In this paper, we propose to base the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition of an integer program on the discretization of the integer polyhedron associated with a subsystem of constraints (as opposed to its convexification). This allows us to formulate the integrality restriction directly on the master variables and sets a theoretical framework for dealing with specific issues such as branching or the introduction of cutting planes in the master. We discuss specific branching schemes and their effect on the structure of the column generation subproblem. We give theoretical bounds on the complexity of the separation process and the extent of the modifications to the column generation subproblem. Our computational tests on the cutting stock problem and a generalisation-the cutting strip problem-show that, in practice, all fractional solutions can be eliminated using branching rules that preserve the tractability of the subproblem, but there is a trade-off between branching efficiency and subproblem tractability.},

Some authors only used cuts expressed over the variables of the original formulation, in order to keep the pricing subproblem relatively easy. Other authors could reduce the duality gaps by also using a restricted number of cuts over the master {LP} variables, stopping when the pricing becomes prohibitively hard. A particularly effective family of such cuts are the subset row cuts. This work introduces a technique for greatly reducing the impact on the pricing of these cuts, thus allowing much more cuts to be added. The newly proposed branch-cut-and-price algorithm also incorporates and combines for the first time (often in an improved way) several elements found in previous works, like route enumeration and strong branching. All the instances used for benchmarking exact algorithms, with up to 199 customers, were solved to optimality. Moreover, some larger instances with up to 360 customers, only considered before by heuristic methods, were solved too.},

	abstract = {In this chapter we present several set-covering-based approaches for solving the Capacitated {VRP} ({CVRP}) and provide an analysis of the effectiveness of the approach. Throughout the chapter we consider the symmetric case, the {CVRP}, although the presented methods may be applied to the {ACVRP} as well. For this purpose, let the index set of the n customers be denoted V = \{1, 2,. .. , n\}. We let 0 denote the depot and V 0 = V ∪ \{0\} the node set of the corresponding complete graph. Associated with customer i ∈ V is the demand d i {\textgreater} 0, which represents the load that must be picked up at customer i's location. We let C denote the vehicle capacity, and we assume there are K vehicles available to perform the delivery. Clearly, feasibility requires that d i ≤ C for each i ∈ V. Let t ij denote the length of edge (i, j) with i, j ∈ V 0. It is assumed that the distances t ij satisfy the triangle inequality; otherwise, one can add a large constant cost to all nodes (or to all edges). A classical method, first suggested by Balinski and Quandt [3], for solving the {CVRP} is based on formulating the problem as a set-covering problem. The idea is as follows. Enumerate all feasible routes, where a feasible route is one that starts and ends at the depot and picks up a total load not exceeding C. Let the index set of all feasible routes be R = \{1, 2,. .. , R\}. Let c r be the cost (e.g., length) of route r, and let S r ⊆ V denote those customers appearing in route r for all r ∈ R. Define α ir = 1 if customer i is served in route r, 0 otherwise for each customer i ∈ V and each route r ∈ R. Also, for every r ∈ R, let y r = 1 if route r is in the optimal solution, 0 otherwise.},

The proposed procedure is based on computing the strong components of the support graph. The procedure possesses a better worst-case time complexity than the standard way of separating {SECs}, which uses maximum ﬂow algorithms, and is easier to implement.},

	abstract = {Low power and long range machine-to-machine (M2M) communication techniques are expected to provide ubiquitous connections for the wireless devices. In this paper, three major low power and long range M2M solutions are surveyed. The ﬁrst type of solutions is referred to as the low power wide area ({LPWA}) network. The design of the {LPWA} techniques features low cost, low data rate, long communication range, and low power consumption. The second type of solutions is the {IEEE} 802.11ah which features higher data rates using a wider bandwidth than the {LPWA}-based solutions. The third type of solutions is operated under the cellular network infrastructure. Based on the analysis of the pros and cons of the enabling technologies of the surveyed M2M solutions, as well as the corresponding deployment strategies, the gaps in knowledge are identiﬁed. The paper also presents a summary of the research directions for improving the performance of the surveyed low power and long range M2M communication technologies.},

	abstract = {The past 10 years have witnessed the rapid growth of global mobile cellular traffic demands due to the popularity of mobile devices. While accurate traffic prediction becomes extremely important for stable and high-quality Internet service, the performance of existing methods is still poor due to three challenges: complicated temporal variations including burstiness and long periods, multi-variant impact factors such as the point of interest and day of the week, and potential spatial dependencies introduced by the movement of population. While existing traditional methods fail in characterizing these features, especially the latter two, deep learning models with powerful representation ability give us a chance to consider these from a new perspective. In this article, we propose Deep Traffic Predictor ({DeepTP}), a deep-learning-based end-toend model, which forecasts traffic demands from spatial-dependent and long-period cellular traffic. {DeepTP} consists of two components: a general feature extractor for modeling spatial dependencies and encoding the external information, and a sequential module for modeling complicated temporal variations. In the general feature extractor, we introduce a correlation selection mechanism for a spatial modeling and embedding mechanism to encode external information. Moreover, we apply a seq2seq model with attention mechanism to build the sequential model. Extensive experiments based on large-scale mobile cellular traffic data demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art traffic prediction models by more than 12.31 percent.},

Smart grids are an emerging trend that introduce intelligence in the power grid to optimize resource usage. In order for this intelligence to be effective, it is necessary to retrieve enough information about the grid operation together with other context data such as environmental variables, and intelligently modify the behavior of the network elements accordingly. This article presents a multi-agent system model for virtual power plants, a new power plant concept in which generation no longer occurs in big installations, but is the result of the cooperation of smaller and more intelligent elements. The proposed model is not only focused on the management of the different elements, but includes a set of agents embedded with artificial neural networks for collaborative forecasting of disaggregated energy demand of domestic end users, the results of which are also shown in this article.},

Therefore, the vision of {SCC} is to improve livability, preservation, revitalization, and attainability of a community. The goal of building {SCC} for a community is to live in the present, plan for the future, and remember the past. We argue that Internet of Things ({IoT}) has the potential to provide a ubiquitous network of connected devices and smart sensors for {SCC}, and big data analytics has the potential to enable the move from {IoT} to real-time control desired for {SCC}. We highlight mobile crowdsensing and cyber-physical cloud computing as two most important {IoT} technologies in promoting {SCC}. As a case study, we present {TreSight}, which integrates {IoT} and big data analytics for smart tourism and sustainable cultural heritage in the city of Trento, Italy.},

	abstract = {In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the efficacy of pretrained neural networks as feature extractors for anomalous sound detection. In doing so, we leverage the knowledge that is contained in these neural networks to extract semantically rich features (representations) that serve as input to a Gaussian Mixture Model which is used as a density estimator to model normality. We compare feature extractors that were trained on data from various domains, namely: images, environmental sounds and music. Our approach is evaluated on recordings from factory machinery such as valves, pumps, sliders and fans. All of the evaluated representations outperform the autoencoder baseline with music based representations yielding the best performance in most cases. These results challenge the common assumption that closely matching the domain of the feature extractor and the downstream task results in better downstream task performance.},

They work very well for the classifi- cation of speech and music signals. {MFCCs} have also been used to classify non-speech sounds for audio surveillance systems, even though {MFCCs} do not completely reflect the time-varying features of non-stationary non-speech signals. We introduce a new 2D-feature set, used with a feature extraction method based on the pitch range ({PR}) of non-speech sounds and the Autocorrelation Function. We compare the classification accuracies of the proposed features of this new method to {MFCCs} by using Support Vec- tor Machines ({SVMs}) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network classifiers. Non-speech environmental sounds: gunshot, glass breaking, scream, dog barking, rain, engine, and restaurant noise, were studied. The new feature set provides high accuracy rates when used as a classifier. Its usage with {MFCCs} significantly improves the accuracy rates of the given classifiers in the range of 4\% to 35\% depending on the classifier used, suggest- ing that both feature sets are complementary. {SVM} classifier using the Gaussian kernel provided the highest accuracy rates among the classifiers used in this study.

We compared our best approaches with the state of the art, showing that we obtain the best recognition rate on the same datasets, without ad hoc parameter optimization. Our study shows that different {CNNs} can be trained for the purpose of animal audio classification and that their fusion works better than the stand-alone classifiers.

	abstract = {This paper presents a successful application of deep learning for object recognition based on acoustic data. The shortcomings of previously employed approaches where handcrafted features describing the acoustic data are being used, include limiting the capability of the found representation to be widely applicable and facing the risk of capturing only insignificant characteristics for a task. In contrast, there is no need to define the feature representation format when using multilayer/deep learning architecture methods: features can be learned from raw sensor data without defining discriminative characteristics a-priori. In this paper, stacked denoising autoencoders are applied to train a deep learning model. Knocking each object in our test set 120 times with a marker pen to obtain the auditory data, thirty different objects were successfully classified in our experiment and each object was knocked 120 times by a marker pen to obtain the auditory data. By employing the proposed deep learning framework, a high accuracy of 91.50\% was achieved. A traditional method using handcrafted features with a shallow classifier was taken as a benchmark and the attained recognition rate was only 58.22\%. Interestingly, a recognition rate of 82.00\% was achieved when using a shallow classifier with raw acoustic data as input. In addition, we could show that the time taken to classify one object using deep learning was far less ( by a factor of more than 6) than utilizing the traditional method. It was also explored how different model parameters in our deep architecture affect the recognition performance.},

	abstract = {An alternative pathway for the human brain to communicate with the outside world is by means of a brain computer interface ({BCI}). A {BCI} can decode electroencephalogram ({EEG}) signals of brain activities, and then send a command or an intent to an external interactive device, such as a wheelchair. The effectiveness of the {BCI} depends on the performance in decoding the {EEG}. Usually, the {EEG} is contaminated by different kinds of artefacts (e.g., electromyogram ({EMG}), background activity), which leads to a low decoding performance. A number of filtering methods can be utilized to remove or weaken the effects of artefacts, but they generally fail when the {EEG} contains extreme artefacts. In such cases, the most common approach is to discard the whole data segment containing extreme artefacts. This causes the fatal drawback that the {BCI} cannot output decoding results during that time. In order to solve this problem, we employ the LombâScargle periodogram to estimate the spectral power from incomplete {EEG} (after removing only parts contaminated by artefacts), and Denoising Autoencoder ({DAE}) for learning. The proposed method is evaluated with motor imagery {EEG} data. The results show that our method can successfully decode incomplete {EEG} to good effect.},

	abstract = {Unlike traditional programs (such as operating systems or word processors) which have large amounts of code, machine learning tasks use programs with relatively small amounts of code (written in machine learning libraries), but voluminous amounts of data. Just like developers of traditional programs debug errors in their code, developers of machine learning tasks debug and fix errors in their data. However, algorithms and tools for debugging and fixing errors in data are less common, when compared to their counterparts for detecting and fixing errors in code. In this paper, we consider classification tasks where errors in training data lead to misclassifications in test points, and propose an automated method to find the root causes of such misclassifications. Our root cause analysis is based on Pearl's theory of causation, and uses Pearl's {PS} (Probability of Sufficiency) as a scoring metric. Our implementation, Psi, encodes the computation of {PS} as a probabilistic program, and uses recent work on probabilistic programs and transformations on probabilistic programs (along with gray-box models of machine learning algorithms) to efficiently compute {PS}. Psi is able to identify root causes of data errors in interesting data sets.},

	title = {"Why Should I Trust You?": Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier},
	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose {LIME}, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks ). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding – and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures – we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets ({CIFAR}-10, {CIFAR}-100, {ImageNet}). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by {CNNs}, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

Recently, Few-Shot Learning ({FSL}) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, {FSL} can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand {FSL}. Starting from a formal definition of {FSL}, we distinguish {FSL} from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in {FSL} is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize {FSL} methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the {FSL} problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.},

This paper proposes a parallel version, the Audio Word2Vec. It offers the vector representations of fixed dimensionality for variable-length audio segments. These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with very attractive real world applications such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection ({STD}). In this {STD} application, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the conventional Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) based approaches at significantly lower computation requirements. We propose unsupervised learning of Audio Word2Vec from audio data without human annotation using Sequence-to-sequence Audoencoder ({SA}). {SA} consists of two {RNNs} equipped with Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) units: the first {RNN} (encoder) maps the input audio sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second {RNN} (decoder) maps the representation back to the input audio sequence. The two {RNNs} are jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder ({DSA}) is furthered proposed offering more robust learning.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

We then propose methods to learn representations using this model which can be effectively used for solving the target task. We study both transductive and inductive transfer learning tasks, showing the effectiveness of our methods for both domain and task adaptation. We show that the learned representations using the proposed {CNN} model generalizes well enough to reach human level accuracy on {ESC}-50 sound events dataset and set state of art results on this dataset. We further use them for acoustic scene classification task and once again show that our proposed approaches suit well for this task as well. We also show that our methods are helpful in capturing semantic meanings and relations as well. Moreover, in this process we also set state-of-art results on Audioset dataset, relying on balanced training set.},

	abstract = {Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments.},

To address this, we develop a modification of the Variational Autoencoder in which encoded observations are decoded to new elements from the same class. This technique, which we call a Variational Homoencoder ({VHE}), produces a hierarchical latent variable model which better utilises latent variables. We use the {VHE} framework to learn a hierarchical {PixelCNN} on the Omniglot dataset, which outperforms all existing models on test set likelihood and achieves strong performance on one-shot generation and classification tasks. We additionally validate the {VHE} on natural images from the {YouTube} Faces database.

Currently, handcrafted features are mostly used for speech emotion recognition, however, features learned automatically using deep learning have shown strong success in many problems, especially in image processing. In particular, deep generative models such as Variational Autoencoders ({VAEs}) have gained enormous success for generating features for natural images. Inspired by this, we propose {VAEs} for deriving the latent representation of speech signals and use this representation to classify emotions.

In this work, we propose to use deep fully convolutional denoising autoencoders ({CDAEs}) for monaural audio source separation. We use as many {CDAEs} as the number of sources to be separated from the mixed signal. Each {CDAE} is trained to separate one source and treats the other sources as background noise. The main idea is to allow each {CDAE} to learn suitable spectral-temporal filters and features to its corresponding source. Our experimental results show that {CDAEs} perform source separation slightly better than the deep feedforward neural networks ({FNNs}) even with fewer parameters than {FNNs}.},

	abstract = {Deep learning methods have achieved high performance in sound recognition tasks. Deciding how to feed the training data is important for further performance improvement. We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning ({BC} learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of {BC} learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of the training data; {BC} learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher's criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that {BC} learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks, datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which {BC} learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition network ({EnvNet}-v2) and train it with {BC} learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.},

In computing a spectrogram, the {STFT} window size parameterizes the trade-off between time and frequency resolution. However, it is not yet known how this parameter affects the operation of the binary mask in terms of separation quality for real-world signals such as speech or music. Here, we demonstrate that the trade-off between time and frequency in the {STFT}, used to perform ideal binary mask separation, depends upon the types of source that are to be separated. In particular, we demonstrate that different window sizes are optimal for separating different combinations of speech and musical signals. Our findings have broad implications for machine audition and machine learning in general.},

To better capture long-range global context, a recent trend is to add a self-attention mechanism on top of the {CNN}, forming a {CNN}-attention hybrid model. However, it is unclear whether the reliance on a {CNN} is necessary, and if neural networks purely based on attention are sufficient to obtain good performance in audio classification. In this paper, we answer the question by introducing the Audio Spectrogram Transformer ({AST}), the first convolution-free, purely attention-based model for audio classification. We evaluate {AST} on various audio classification benchmarks, where it achieves new state-of-the-art results of 0.485 {mAP} on {AudioSet}, 95.6\% accuracy on {ESC}-50, and 98.1\% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

The {VRP} is closely related to delivery-type problems and appears in a large number of practical situations concerning the distribution of commodities. The present work focuses on a commodity flow formulation presented by Gavish and Graves. This formulation includes two sets of variables and, hence, it also must include coupling constraints between the two sets of variables. These coupling constraints can be defined in several ways. The main result of this work establishes that when the strongest form of the coupling constraints is used in the flow formulation, the equivalent formulation using only the Xq variables satisfies the so called multistar constraints which, for certain parameters, induce facets of the non-directed {VRP} polytope. Using an idea taken from Gouveia, we show how to derive a more compact representation, in the number of constraints, of the multistar constraints. Some consequences of our projection result are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Machine-to-Machine (M2M) networks require more elaborate design of medium access control ({MAC}) due to their higher complexity in system management. In many applications of M2M networking, the major trafﬁc pattern consists of data collected from several source nodes to a sink through a unidirectional tree. Earlier prevalence of Carrier-Sense Multiple Access ({CSMA}) has continuously been being switched to Time-Division Multiple Access ({TDMA}). The main drawback of {CSMA} is idle listening, which refers to the fact that the nodes have to unnecessarily wake up due to lack of schedule. Energy inefﬁciency of a network gets higher as the number of nodes committed to idle listening, which seriously limits the scalability of a network. Recent enhancement of hardware has been enabling sufﬁciently accurate synchronization while keeping energy consumption low enough, which mitigates the main drawback of {TDMA}. This paper proposes a {TDMA}-based {MAC} protocol that achieves higher energy efﬁciency in centralized M2M communications. As a {TDMA}-based protocol, the proposed protocol is fully scheduled and hence no idle listening occurs. Moreover, the protocol reduces the length of a multi-hop transaction which results in higher energy efﬁciency as well as lower latency. Simulation results show that the proposed {MAC} protocol outperforms the conventional {CSMA} and other popular {MAC} schemes, in terms of energy consumption, delay, and packet delivery ratio ({PDR}).},

This new kind of communication, however, entails a lot of challenges that need to be addressed, especially for what concerns the integration between the human­ triggered traffic, i.e., the traffic generated by the people through smartphones and tablets, and machine-triggered traffic, i.e., the data that are autonomously generated by Machine-Type Devices, in the next generation cellular networks, i.e., the {SG}. These two types of traffic are completely different, but while the former has been widely studied and appropriately modeled, the latter is still lacking a generally accepted model. In this paper, after a brief survey on traffic models that have been proposed by the academic and the standardization community, we propose and test a general framework to evaluate the performance of a generic cellular network architecture in the context of joint human-triggered and machine-triggered traffic.},

We classify {IoT} traﬃc into four classes: Fixed-Bit Periodic ({FBP}), Variable-Bit Periodic ({VBP}), Fixed-Bit Aperiodic ({FBA}), and Variable-Bit Aperiodic ({VBA}). We show that {LSTM} outperforms all of the other models signiﬁcantly in the symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error ({sMAPE}) measure for devices in the {VBP} class in our simulations. Furthermore, we show that {LSTM} has almost the same performance in this metric for the {FBA} class as {MLP} and 1-D {CNN}. While the training time per {IoT} device is the highest for {LSTM}, all of the forecasting models have reasonable training times for practical implementation. Our results suggest an architecture in which an {IoT} Gateway predicts the future traﬃc of {IoT} devices in the {FBP}, {VBP} and {FBA} classes and pre-allocates the uplink wireless channel for these classes in advance in order to alleviate the Massive Access Problem of M2M communication.},

With the emergence of diverse classes of services, where the available devices for the services and their patterns of use are changing rapidly, most of the existing forecasting methods may not be applicable. Therefore, this study designed a new methodology for traﬃc forecasts, a device-based forecasting that consider mobile traﬃc from various devices for mobile services. The proposed approach performs the three-round Delphi process to complement the experts’ opinions in forecasting mobile traﬃc for 10 years. In particular, scenario analysis was applied to reﬂect uncertainty of future dynamic situations, investigating optimistic, neutral and pessimistic scenarios. In addition, the forecasting performance of the suggested approach was validated by comparing it with that of traditional forecasting tools. The research ﬁndings indicate that mobile traﬃc will increase rapidly, and the patterns of use for mobile devices will change to some extent, which will provide strategic implications for both companies and government.},

Such traffic is used today by modern M2M devices. The peculiarity of M2M traffic consists in its generation by a large number of devices. The number of such devices can be many times greater than the number of regular users. The share of this traffic is more than an order of magnitude less than the video traffic. M2M device traffic is poorly understood and much less predictable. Thus, when developing new technologies, it is necessary to focus a lot on this traffic. The paper contains the results of M2M traffic analysis and develops model of M2M traffic. The 3GPP model was chosen as the base model. The analysis of this model is given, and also its modification is offered. This model allows to simulate the traffic at the unlimited time interval. A feature of this model is the stability characteristics of the devices. It allows to evaluate not only the initial attempts to transmit messages, but also attempts caused by reduced service quality. The mathematical description of the model and simulation results are obtained in the research. It describes the traffic of M2M devices and its impact on quality of service in the network. The obtained results can be used to model the traffic of M2M devices and to select their parameters. In addition, algorithms have been developed to control M2M devices during possible overloads.},

According to the results of approximate entropy, echo state network is selected to predict high complexity components, support vector machine is used to predict medium complexity components, and autoregressive integrated moving average model is introduced to predict low complexity components. The advantages of each prediction model are used to predict the appropriate component. The final prediction results are obtained by adding the predicted values of each component. In order to solve the problem that the prediction performance of support vector machine and echo state network is affected by their parameters, an improved whale optimization algorithm is proposed to optimize the parameters of the model. Meanwhile, the calculation results of approximate entropy show that compared with the original network traffic, the complexity of each component obtained by ensemble empirical mode decomposition is reduced, which reduces the complexity of modeling. Three network traffic datasets with sampling periods of 10 ms, 1 s, and 10 min are collected. Compared with the other five state-of-the-art prediction models, the case study results show that the proposed prediction model has better prediction accuracy and excellent statistical performance indicators.},

	abstract = {Frequently count time series exhibit overdispersion, but the opposite phenomenon of underdispersion is well documented in some situations, thus may be encountered in real applications. The {INGARCH} model is a popular tool for modeling time series of counts. The Poisson and negative binomial models can only deal with overdispersion, and the double Poisson and generalized Poisson models can treat both of them, but the latter two models have some shortcomings or limitations. The revived {COM}-Poisson distribution is flexible in modeling a wide range of overdispersion and underdispersion with only two parameters, while possessing properties that make it methodologically appealing and useful in practice, thus we introduce a new {INGARCH} model based on this distribution. We give an approximate condition for stationarity and expressions for mean, variance and autocorrelation function and test the accuracy of these expressions via simulations and real examples. We discuss the maximum likelihood estimation procedure for the parameters of interest. In addition, we also try to find influences of different distributions on {INGARCH} models using three real data sets. The results show that the generalized Poisson and {COM}-Poisson models perform well in most cases and the {COM}-Poisson model is a powerful competitor compared with the generalized Poisson model.},

We suggest a computationally feasible approach to these problems, focusing especially on the detection and estimation of sudden shifts and outliers. To identify successfully such unusual events we employ the maximum of score tests, whose critical values in ﬁnite samples are determined by parametric bootstrap.

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher’s information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {Some Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication links particularly those in a industrial automation plant have stringent latency requirements. In this paper, we study the delay-performance for the M2M uplink from the sensors to a Programmable Logic Controller ({PLC}) in a industrial automation scenario. The uplink trafﬁc can be broadly classiﬁed as either Periodic Update ({PU}) and Event Driven ({ED}). The {PU} arrivals from different sensors are periodic, synchronized by the {PLC} and need to be processed by a prespeciﬁed ﬁrm latency deadline. On the other hand, the {ED} arrivals are random, have lowarrival rate, but may need to be processed quickly depending upon the criticality of the application. To accommodate these contrasting Quality-of-Service ({QoS}) requirements, we model the utility of {PU} and {ED} packets using step function and sigmoidal functions of latency respectively. Our goal is to maximize the overall system utility while being proportionally fair to both {PU} and {ED} data. To this end, we propose a novel online {QoS}-aware packet scheduler that gives priority to {ED} data as long as that results the latency deadline is met for {PU} data. However as the size of networks increases, we drop the {PU} packets that fail to meet latency deadline which reduces congestion and improves overall system utility. Using extensive simulations, we compare the performance of our scheme with various scheduling policies such as First-Come-First-Serve ({FCFS}), Earliest-Due-Date ({EDD}) and (preemptive) priority. We show that our scheme outperforms the existing schemes for various simulation scenarios.},

The evolved node B ({eNodeB}) acknowledges the successful reception of a preamble if that preamble is transmitted by only one device. To reduce the burstiness of the connection requests in heavy trafﬁc situations, access class barring ({ACB}) is proposed in the 3GPP standard. Using {ACB}, an {MTC} device postpones its request in a {RACH} with a probability p. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive {ACB} scheme for congestion control of bursty M2M trafﬁc. The optimal value of the {ACB} depends on the total number of {MTC} devices competing in a {RACH}. To estimate this number, we derive a joint conditional probability distribution function ({PDF}) for the number of preambles selected by zero or one {MTC} device, conditioned on the number of {MTC} devices that passed the {ACB} check. We design a maximum likelihood estimator using this {PDF}. We use this estimation to dynamically adjust the {ACB} factor. To further improve our estimation, we use Kalman ﬁltering based on the dynamics of the system. Numerical results show that the total service time for the proposed method is very close to the optimal case where the information of the number of {MTC} devices is given.},

	abstract = {Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is one of the leading facilitators of the Internet of Things environment by offering ubiquitous applications and services. Using cellular networks for providing M2M connectivity brings several advantages such as extended coverage, security, robust management, and lower deployment costs; however, coexistence with a large number of M2M devices is still an essential challenge in {LTE}-A networks, in part due to the difﬁculty in allowing simultaneous access. Although the random access procedure in {LTE}-A is adequate for human-to-human (H2H) communications, when M2M communications are involved congestion control is required. One of the congestion control schemes suggested by the 3GPP is Access Class Barring ({ACB}), which can reduce the number of simultaneous users contending for access. However, it is still not clear how to adapt {ACB} parameters in bursty and heavy-loaded scenarios, such as those that appear in M2M communications. We propose a dynamic {ACB} scheme in which an estimate of the current number of M2M devices in backoff state is used to adjust in real-time the barring rate parameter. We evaluate the key performance indicators ({KPIs}) of dynamic {ACB} in several scenarios with different degrees of trafﬁc load and compare them with those of a static {ACB} with optimal parameters. We show that the dynamic {ACB} outperforms the static one offering shorter access delay and higher successful access probability, while its impact on H2H communications {KPIs} is negligible. Besides, our proposed scheme conforms with the {LTE}-A speciﬁcation so that it can be included as a viable solution.},

In this paper, a directed information ({DI}) learning framework is proposed to predict the source trafﬁc in eventdriven {MTC}. By capturing the history of transmissions during past events by a sequence of binary random variables, the {DI} between different machine type devices ({MTDs}) is calculated and used for predicting the set of possible {MTDs} that are likely to report an event. Analytical and simulation results show that the proposed {DI} learning method can reveal the correlation between transmission from different {MTDs} that report the same event, and the order in which they transmit their data. The proposed algorithm and the presented results show that the {DI} can be used to implement effective predictive resource allocation for eventdriven {MTC}.},

Network traffic prediction is an important operational and management function for any data network. It has a significant role in today’s increasingly complex and diverse networks. Network traffic prediction is also more important for {IoT} networks to provide reliable communication. The artificial neural network ({ANN}) has been successfully applied to traffic prediction. In this paper, we perform the {IoT} traffic time series prediction using a multistep ahead prediction with Time Series {NARX} Feedback Neural Networks. The estimation error of a prediction approach has been evaluated using the performance functions {MSE}, {SSE}, and {MAE}, besides, another measure of prediction accuracy the mean absolute percent of error ({MAPE}).},

	shorttitle = {Traffic Prediction and Random Access Control Optimization},
	abstract = {Random access schemes in modern wireless communications are generally based on the framed-{ALOHA} (f-{ALOHA}), which can be optimized by ﬂexibly organizing devices’ transmission and re-transmission. However, this optimization is generally intractable due to the lack of information about complex trafﬁc generation statistics and the occurrence of the random collision. In this article, we ﬁrst summarize the general structure of access control optimization for different random access schemes, and then review the existing access control optimization based on Machine Learning ({ML}) and non-{ML} techniques. We demonstrate that the {ML}-based methods can better optimize the access control problem compared with non-{ML} based methods, due to their capability in solving high complexity long-term optimization problem and learning experiential knowledge from reality. To further improve the random access performance, we propose two-step learning optimizers for access control optimization, which individually execute the trafﬁc prediction and the access control conﬁguration. In detail, our trafﬁc prediction method relies on online supervised learning adopting Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}) that can accurately capture trafﬁc statistics over consecutive frames, and the access control conﬁguration can use either a non-{ML} based controller or a cooperatively trained Deep Reinforcement Learning ({DRL}) based controller depending on the complexity of different random access schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed two-step cooperative learning optimizer considerably outperforms the conventional Deep {QNetwork} ({DQN}) in terms of higher training efﬁciency and better access performance.},

	abstract = {Due to the fast increase of sensing data and quick response requirement in the Internet of Things ({IoT}) delivery network, the high speed transmission has emerged as an important issue. Assigning suitable channels in the wireless {IoT} delivery network is a basic guarantee of high speed transmission. However, the high dynamics of trafﬁc load ({TL}) make the conventional ﬁxed channel assignment algorithm ineffective. Recently, the software deﬁned networking-based {IoT} ({SDN}-{IoT}) is proposed to improve the transmission quality. Besides this, the intelligent technique of deep learning is widely researched in high computational {SDN}. Hence, we ﬁrst propose a novel deep learning-based {TL} prediction algorithm to forecast future {TL} and congestion in network. Then, a deep learning-based partially channel assignment algorithm is proposed to intelligently allocate channels to each link in the {SDN}-{IoT} network. Finally, we consider a deep learning-based prediction and partially overlapping channel assignment to propose a novel intelligent channel assignment algorithm, which can intelligently avoid potential congestion and quickly assign suitable channels in {SDN}-{IoT}. The simulation result demonstrates that our proposal signiﬁcantly outperforms conventional channel assignment algorithms.},

However, the established statistical properties of these tests are only valid when each pair of responses are independent, where each sampling unit has only one pair of responses. When each sampling unit consists of a cluster of paired responses, the assumption of independent pairs is violated. In this article, we apply the within-cluster resampling technique to U-statistics to form new tests and rank-based correlation estimators for possibly tied clustered data. We develop large sample properties of the new proposed tests and estimators and evaluate their performance by simulations.

Over its lifespan the {VRP} literature has become quite disjointed and disparate. Keeping track of its development has become difﬁcult because its subject matter transcends several academic disciplines and professions that range from algorithm design to trafﬁc management. Consequently, this paper deﬁnes {VRP}’s domain in its entirety, accomplishes an all-encompassing taxonomy for the {VRP} literature, and delineates all of {VRP}’s facets in a parsimonious and discriminating manner. Sample articles chosen for their disparity are classiﬁed to illustrate the descriptive power and parsimony of the taxonomy. Moreover, all previously published {VRP} taxonomies are shown to be relatively myopic; that is, they are subsumed by what is herein presented. Because the {VRP} literature encompasses esoteric and highly theoretical articles at one extremum and descriptions of actual applications at the other, the article sampling includes the entire range of the {VRP} literature.},

Transforming the problem into an equivalent Path-Partitioning Problem allows us to exploit its polyhedral structure and to generate strong cuts corresponding to facetinducing inequalities. By using cuts defined by multistars, partial multistars and generalized subtour elimination constraints, we are able to consistently solve 60-city problems to proven optimality and are currently attempting to solve problems involving a hundred cities. We also present details of the computer implementation and our computational results.},

	abstract = {In open vehicle routing problems, the vehicles are not required to return to the depot after completing service. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst exact optimization algorithm for the open version of the well-known capacitated vehicle routing problem ({CVRP}). The algorithm is based on branch-and-cut. We show that, even though the open {CVRP} initially looks like a minor variation of the standard {CVRP}, the integer programming formulation and cutting planes need to be modiﬁed in subtle ways.},

	abstract = {We consider the Vehicle Routing Problem, in which a ﬁxed ﬂeet of delivery vehicles of uniform capacity must service known customer demands for a single commodity from a common depot at minimum transit cost. This difﬁcult combinatorial problem contains both the Bin Packing Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem ({TSP}) as special cases and conceptually lies at the intersection of these two well-studied problems. The capacity constraints of the integer programming formulation of this routing model provide the link between the underlying routing and packing structures. We describe a decomposition-based separation methodology for the capacity constraints that takes advantage of our ability to solve small instances of the {TSP} efﬁciently. Specifically, when standard procedures fail to separate a candidate point, we attempt to decompose it into a convex combination of {TSP} tours; if successful, the tours present in this decomposition are examined for violated capacity constraints; if not, the Farkas Theorem provides a hyperplane separating the point from the {TSP} polytope. We present some extensions of this basic concept and a general framework within which it can be applied to other combinatorial models. Computational results are given for an implementation within the parallel branch, cut, and price framework {SYMPHONY}.},
