% memoir is a documentclass based on book.
% The memoir class incorporates the functions of a large number of commonly used packages
% to provide a more consistent interface, and is designed to be easy to customize.
% So instead of loading a dozen possibly conflicting packages---geometry to change margins,
% and setspace to change line spacing, and titlesec to format

% section headings, etc., etc.---you just specify memoir
% as your document class and use its settings



%%% IMPORTANT:    oneside   vs   twoside
%%%     twoside:
%%%        The twoside flag to memoir generates a PDF where even and odd pages are treated differently.
%%%        Specifically the margin is handled differently depending if it is an odd or even page.
%%%
%%%        PROS: The twoside flag is specifically useful for generating PDFs that should then be prepressed
%%%              into an actual physical book.
%%%              The first page of a chapter always starts in a odd page.
%%%        CONS: Digital reading of the pdf becomes awkard since when scrolling the text constantly
%%%              shifts left and right depending on the page index
%%%
%%%     oneside:
%%%         All pages are handled with the same margin, and are all treated the same
%%%
%%%         PROS: PDF better suited for digital reading on a computer
%%%         CONS: Prepressing on an actual book will lead to a lower quality result compared to the twoside.
%%%               Chapter first page can start at even an odd pages

%%% Memoir by default assumes twoside PDF if nothing is specified.
