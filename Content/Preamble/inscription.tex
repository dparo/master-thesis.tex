% 		unworthy occupations or in talk; look upon it as the quintessence of life, as
% 		to a certain extent sacred. Evening is like old age: we are languid,
% 		talkative, silly. Each day is a little life: every waking and rising a little
% 		birth, every fresh morning a little youth, every going to rest and sleep a
% 		little death.} \\ \medskip Arthur Schopenhauer
