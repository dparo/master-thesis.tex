\chapter{Performance Profiles}
These experiments were last updated at February 8, 2022.

Let $Q$ and $k$ denote respectively the CVRP vehicle capacity and number of vehicles.
Define a scale factor $s \in \N$, a new CVRP instance is generated from the old one using the following steps (described as pseudoalgorithm):

\begin{align}
	Q \gets Q \times s \\
	k \gets \ceil*{\frac{k}{s}}
\end{align}

Each performance profile follows the syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
	<FAMILY-NAME>-scaled-<s>-last-10
\end{verbatim}

where \texttt{<FAMILY>} denotes the CVRP instances family (i.e. E, F, etc) and \texttt{<s>} is the scale factor for the vehicle capacity.
The term \texttt{last-10} is used to denote that the performance profile uses only the last 10 pricing iterations for performing the comparison.

At the time of writing, only the following scaling factors were tested: $s = 1.0,\ s = 2.0,\ s = 4.0$.
