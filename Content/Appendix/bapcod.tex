\section{Employed \bapcod\ Parametrization}
\label{sec:employed-bapcod-parametrization}

This section lists more exhaustively all the \bapcod\ parameters
that were employed to obtain the results of this thesis.
The parameters' names and their meaning are described in the technical report of \textcite{sadykov2021}.
We will not cover all the parameters in this section,
we will concentrate on the most important ones only.
The technical report alone is not enough to fully comprehend what each parameter do,
therefore it is highly suggested to first read the scientific document of \textcite{pessoa2020a},
where \bapcod\ and its VRPSolver extension were employed to solve many VRP instances.

\subsection{Core parameters}

These parameters are used to control the general behavior of \bapcod.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Controlling the logging verbosity:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{DEFAULTPRINTLEVEL = 0}.
		            Controls the verbosity of the logging system of \bapcod\ by setting it to a relatively quiet level.
		      \item \texttt{printMasterPrimalSols = 2}.
		            By setting this parameter to 2, \bapcod\ will print the fractional solution after each column generation convergence.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Controlling the runtime:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{GlobalTimeLimit = 3600}. Sets the maximum allowed solving time to one hour.
		      \item \texttt{colGenSubProbSolMode = 3}. Tells \bapcod\ to use the custom user-provided pricing functor.
		            In our case, the pricing functor is a stubbed implementation which wraps the original VRPSolver extension pricing functor
		            and times it.
		            By setting such parameters to other values, it is possible to tell \bapcod\ to use a default generic MIP solver to solve the sub-problems.
		      \item \texttt{ApplyPreprocessing = true}. Tells \bapcod, to apply pre-processing to adjust bounds and remove redundant constraints.
		      \item \texttt{PreprocessVariablesLocalBounds = false}.
		            Prevents \bapcod\ from changing the variable bounds of sub-problems after pre-processing.
		            Since our pricer does not support changing the bounds of the variables,
		            we disable this feature.
		      \item \texttt{CheckSpOracleFeasibility = false}.
		            This feature is useful for debugging when developing custom pricing functors.
		            When this parameter is set to true, it allows to use an expensive MIP resolution process
		            to verify the correctness of the pricer algorithm.
		            The MIP is employed to check whether the produced columns satisfy all the master problem constraints.
		            In our case it is disabled.
		      \item \texttt{CheckOracleOptimality = false}.
		            Similar to the \texttt{CheckSpOracleFeasibility} parameter, but also verifies the optimality of the generated columns.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Controlling the column generation procedure:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{GenerateProperColumns = false}.
		            When this parameter is set to true, \bapcod\ will error-out if the pricer produces any non-proper column,
		            i.e. a column not respecting the sub-problem variable bounds.
		            In our case we set this parameter to false, because from our experiments it didn't seem to coope correctly with the VRPSolver pricing functor.
		      \item \texttt{MaxNbOfStagesInColGenProcedure = 3}.
		            Sets the number of stages the pricer is allowed to use.
		            When the stage iteration is greater than 1, the pricer is allowed to use
		            progressively faster (but less exhaustive) heuristics for determining columns.
		            When the stage iteration reaches stage 0, the pricing problem should be solved exactly.
		            \bapcod\ automatically switches to a lower stage when the previous stage converges (i.e. fails to find any reduced cost column).
		            The technical document suggests to set this parameter to $3$ when the VRPSolver extension is in use.
		            The VRPSolver extension implements two heuristic stages by using a modification of the bidirectional label setting algorithm, see the \textit{Pricing heuristics} section of \textcite{sadykov2021a}.
		      \item \texttt{ReducedCostFixingThreshold = 0.0}.
		            Tells \bapcod\ to not apply reduced cost fixing.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Controlling the cut generation:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{MasterCuttingPlanesDepthLimit = -1}.
		            When this parameter is set to $-1$, it disables cut generation of core cuts
		            (i.e. the cuts natively supported within the BPC framework).
		            The cut generation of user-defined cuts
		            is not effected by this parameter, and therefore it must be disabled manually.
		      \item \texttt{MaxNbOfCutGeneratedAtEachIter = 0}.
		            Sets the maximum number of core cuts added per cut round to $0$,
		            effectively further enforcing the deactivation of the core cuts generation.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Controlling the branching procedure:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseOne=""}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseTwo=""}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseThree=""}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseFour=""}
		            These parameters control the multiple phases of strong branching employed in \bapcod.
		            By setting each parameter to the empty string, we effectively disable strong branching for each phase.
		      \item \texttt{SimplifiedStrongBranchingParameterisation = false}.
		            When this parameter is set to true, \bapcod populates the parameters \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseOne}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseTwo}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseThree}, \texttt{StrongBranchingPhaseFour}
		            with simple default values.
		            Since populating these parameters would effectively re-enable branching, we set \texttt{SimplifiedStrongBranchingParameterisation} to false.
	      \end{itemize}

	\item Controlling the RCSP dynamic programming labeling pricer:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \texttt{RCSPuseBidirectionalSearch = 2}.
		            This parameter, referred as $\phi^\mt{bidir}$ in the scientific paper,
		            tells the RCSP pricer to use the bidirectional search for solving the pricing problem.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPapplyReducedCostFixing = 1}.
		            This parameter, reffered as $\phi^\mt{elim}$ in the scientific paper,
		            tells the pricer to employ the default standard bucket arc elimination discussed in \textcite{sadykov2021a}.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPmaxNumOfColsPerExactIteration = 1}, \texttt{RCSPmaxNumOfColsPerIteration = 1}.
		            These parameters, reffered as $\gamma^\mt{exact}, \gamma^\mt{heur}$ respectively in the scientific paper,
		            control the number of generated columns per iteration by the pricer respecitively in the heuristic and exact stages.
		            Since our pricer is able to produce a single column per pricing iteration, in order to achieve a fair comparison,
		            we set the label setting algorithm to always generate a single route per pricing iteration.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPallowRoutesWithSameVerticesSet = false}.
		            This parameter tells the labeling algorithm whether outputting multiple routes passing the same set of vertices are allowed.
		            When disable, it can allow the pricer to generate a more diverse set of routes, at the cost of increasing the pricing running time.
		            Since we're forcing to labeling algorithm to generate a single route regardless, this parameter should have no effect.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPmaxNumOfEnumSolutionsForMIP = 0}.
		            This parameter, referred as $\omega^\mt{MIP}$ in the scientific paper,
		            controls the threshold at which the number of enumerated paths can trigger a direct solve of the SP formulation through a MIP (route enumeration).
		            Since we are interested in measuring the pricing complexity, it makes sense to disable the route enumeration feature.
		            We can disable such feature by setting the corresponding parameter to $0$.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPstopCutGenTimeThresholdInPricing = 1e21}, \texttt{RCSPhardTimeThresholdInPricing = 1e21}.
		            These parameters, referred as $\tau^\mt{soft}, \tau^\mt{hard}$ respectively in the scientific paper,
		            control the soft and hard time thresholds for the pricing algorithm.
		            These thresholds impact the tailing-off condition of the pricer, namely, if the running time of the pricer exceeds one of these thresholds, column generation is preemptively interrupted in favor of cut generation or branching.
		            We're interested in measuring the performance of the label setting algorithm even when it is struggling, therefore we set those parameters to high values to disable the tailing off condition.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPdynamicNGmode = 1}.
		            This parameter tells BapCod to scale dynamically
		            the ng-sets size based on the
		            fractional solution obtained by the column generation
		            (not based on the solution received from the pricing problem).
		      \item \texttt{RCSPinitNGneighbourhoodSize = 8}, \texttt{RCSPmaxNGneighbourhoodSize = 63}.
		            These parameters, referred as $\eta^\mt{init}, \eta^\mt{max}$ respectively in the scientific paper,
		            sets the bounds in which the ng-set size can freely dynamically change.
		            Raising $\eta^\mt{init}$ can improve the dual bound generated from the pricer, but usually leads to explosion of computation times, especially if it is raised a lot.
		            Therefore keeping $\eta^\mt{init}$ small and raising $\eta^\mt{max}$ is instead the preferred approach if one seeks to improve the dual bound at each branch-and-bound node.
		            The ng-sets size starts at the smaller value $\eta^\mt{init}$, and it is raised dyanamically (if param \texttt{RCSPdynamicNGmode} is enabled) only when needed.
		            Since our pricer produces elementary routes, thus generating the best dual bounds possible, we want to stress the labeling algorithm to try as hard as possible to achieve
		            reasonable dual bounds. Therefore, by setting $\eta^\mt{init} = 8$ and $\eta^\mt{max} = 64$ we force the labeling algorithm to produce better dual bounds towards the end
		            of the column generation convergence.
		      \item \texttt{RCSPmaxNGaverNeighbourhoodSize = 63}.
		            This parameter is very similar to the $\eta^\mt{max}$ parameter, but for the average case.
		            In our case we set this parameter to the same value of $\eta^\mt{max}$ as it was suggested from one of the \bapcod\ authors: Ruslan Sadykov.
		      \item \texttt{CutTailingOffThreshold = 0.0000001}, \texttt{CutTailingOffCounterThreshold = 999999}.
		            These parameters, referred as $\delta^\mt{gap}, \delta^\mt{num}$ respectively in the scientific paper,
		            controls the tailing off condition of cut-separation, i.e. the threshold
		            at which the BPC deems cuts ineffective and switches to lower priority
		            (and usually more computationally expensive) cuts.
		            Despite their name and their application to cut separation, these two important
		            parameters also affect the column generation procedure.
		            As pointed out in the original paper,
		            increasing the ng-sets size can be seen as a form of "cut generation"
		            since it improves the dual bound.
		            Since we always prefer to augment the ng-sets as much as possible we want
		            to disable the cut-tailing off conditions.
		            We can disable the cut-tailing off condition by setting these parameters to the above values.

[ About what is reduced cost fixing ]
[ Bucket arc elimination procedure = Reduced cost fixing procedure]
\textcite{sadykov2021}
VRPSolver extension includes an implementation of the pricing functor which
allows the user to define the subproblems as resource constrained shortest path
problems in graphs. The functor implements the bucket-graph based labeling
algorithm from paper [16] for solving the pricing problem, as well as the corre-
sponding bucket arc elimination procedure (i.e. reduced cost fixing procedure),
and the elementary route enumeration procedure [1]. VRPSolver extension also
implements cut separation functors for rounded cap
