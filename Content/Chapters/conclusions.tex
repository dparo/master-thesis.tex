The advantage of branch-and-cut software packages is that
they allow for heavy use of parallelization basically for free,
while current label-setting algorithms are single-threaded.
The branch-and-cut frameworks can also be easily extended
to become a heuristic pricer
(see mathheuristics: adding an invalid constraint to speed up the convergence of the MIP solver)
by employing
solutions such as hard-fixing.
Hard fixing is a form of randomized diving,
where given any feasible solution,
we fix randomly some variables and we repeat the resolution
process.
Soft-fixing, base on local branching). is another method
to extend a MIP formulation and solver to provide
heuristic solutions.
In local-branching a infeasible extra-constraints is added
which imposes that a new optimal solution
is not far a part from a provided feasible solution.
This heavily prunes the search space, but still
allows the MIP solver to decide which variables
to fix as to provide the best outcome possible.

Implement smarter branching schemes, such as branching over cutsets.
Study more effective cutting planes and
faster separation techniques.
Study more effecitve bounding procedures and cutting off values
prior to starting the resolution process through the MIP.

Use min-cut heuristic procedures to improve
the running time of the fractional separation
such as is done \textcite{kernighan1970}.
Such heuristic procedure may overestimate the max-flow
value thus the fractional separation procedure may
become blind to certain violated inequalities that were
there, but couldn't be computed due to the heuristic procedure.
Since the heuristic is faster than the exact push-relabel
algorithm ($O(n^2.2)$), it may be run on each fractional
separation.

Other improvements: improve the initial dual bound of the branch-and-cut
algorithm by pricing an initial q-route using the labeling algorithm,
or by using the branch-and-cut itself.

Another possible solution could be to emulate the decremental state space
relaxation, but by employing the branch-and-cut frameworks itself.
The branch-and-cut algorithm is asked to first generate $q$-routes by
relaxing the bounds on the $y_i$ mip variables,
and then for each vertex visited twice of more, the associated bound
on the $y_i$ is strengthened.

\medskip

We noticed many branch-and-bound nodes being generated,
suggesting that a smarter and more effective bounding technique to
generate an effective initial dual bound could speed up the convergence
of the MIP solver by reducing the number of branching occurrences.

Heuristic algorithm to solve maxflow???

Possibly improve converge speed by using heuristic patching at each
node of the branch-and-bound tree.


Furthers study, develop new (strong) cutting-planes approaches,
that achieve a good trade off between their separation and gain
in the dual-bound improvement.


Extend the branch-and-cut algorithm
to the general ESPPRC.
Problems in IP formulation:
requires direct network case (thus less compact model, unfortunate since compact formulation are
preferred for branch-and-cut algorithms),
computational stability issues in handling big-M
for handling resource constraints at the edge or node level (such as time windows constraints),

	Furthermore, a comparison with state-of-the-art dynamic programming algorithms has
	shown that the BAC algorithm is competitive, and acts as a good complement to the dynamic programming algorithms.
	That is, in some case the dynamic programming algorithms are much faster and able to solve instances that cannot be
	solved by the BAC algorithm. On the other hand the BAC algorithm appear to be superior on very large instances, e.g., the
	BAC algorithm solved instances with up to 800 nodes compared to a maximum of 200 nodes for the dynamic programming
	algorithms. There is a tendency towards, that the BAC algorithm is faster than the dynamic programming algorithms on
	instances with highly negative weights and is slower on instances with solution values close to 0. This is not too surprising
	since the bounding functions used in the dynamic programming algorithms is expected to cut off large parts of the state-
	space in the latter case. This may render the BAC algorithms less efficient in a column generation scheme for current state-
	of-the-art algorithms, since instances with much negativity are usually solved heuristically and only the instances with cost
	near zero are solved to optimality. However, our experiments indicate that the BAC algorithm may prove to be worthwhile
	when the number of nodes increases (to more than the current maximum of 151 nodes for the CVRP). To sum up, the BAC
	algorithm solved 58 out of a total 76 instances which is 18 more than the dynamic programming algorithms, and the BAC
	algorithm appears to have its strength when the number of nodes is large.

	We believe that there is a large unexploited potential in BAC algorithms for CPTP, and hence the paper is intended to
	serve as a platform for further development, also acting as a survey/tutorial. Future research can experiment with subsets
	of the presented cuts, extensions of the cuts, and the interplay between these.

Moder nMIP solvers implementing the branch-and-cut approach have been progressing at a
fast pace for the last 30 years, and now they have found a widespread use around
the globe. The branch-and-cut approach however has its limits. It is not efficient
(i.e. does not scale well) for problems for which all known linear relaxations are not
sufficiently tight, even after adding cutting planes. These are problems with complex
combinatorial structure appearing for example in routing, scheduling, packing
and other similar applications.
A radical way to improve the quality of linear relaxations is to substantially
increase the number of variables. For such formulations however it is not possible
to apply directly the standard branch-and-cut approach as variables should then be
generated dynamically. An extension of branch-and-cut to this case is called branch-
cut-and-price, in which the linear relaxation of the problem is solved by the column
generation approach.

\mytodo{Extend the CPTP model to consider VRPTW, and re-evaluate the empirical results}

\begin{comment}
\cite{jepsen2011}
Although the main focus of this thesis is exact solution methods, it is impor-
tant to remember that in real life the computational time needed to find the
optimal solution is not always available therefore it is important that the
exact solution algorithms can find good solutions within reasonable time.
Danna and Le Pape [18] have shown how to integrate the Branch-and-Price
algorithm with a local search framework. This integration helps the bcp
algorithm with finding good integer solutions in the early stages of the al-
gorithm. The method has show to result in reasonable good solutions for
the vrptw. Prescott-Gagnon et al. [55] have improved the heuristic ap-
proach for bcp algorithms further by integrating the bcp algorithm with
large neighbourhood search. For bac algorithms methods such as local
branching introduced by Fischetti and Lodi [28] and the feasibility pump
introduced by Fischetti et al. [29] can be used to find fast and good solu-
tions. The main benefit of the exact solution approach is that it provides
both an upper and lower bound.
Though when a fast good solution is needed a heuristics such as the
adaptive large scale neighbourhood search by Pisinger and Ropke [54] for
cvrp, vrptw and many other Vehicle Routing variants or the local search
heuristic by Zachariadis and Kiranoudis [65] are preferable.
