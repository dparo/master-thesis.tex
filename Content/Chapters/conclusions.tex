\chapter{Conclusions and Future work}
\label{sec:conclusions-and-future-work}

The advantage of branch-and-cut software packages is that
they allow for heavy use of parallelization basically for free,
while current label-setting algorithms are single-threaded.

\subsection{Future work}
\mytodo{Extend the CPTP model to consider VRPTW, and re-evaluate the empirical results}

\cite{jepsen2011}
Although the main focus of this thesis is exact solution methods, it is impor-
tant to remember that in real life the computational time needed to find the
optimal solution is not always available therefore it is important that the
exact solution algorithms can find good solutions within reasonable time.
Danna and Le Pape [18] have shown how to integrate the Branch-and-Price
algorithm with a local search framework. This integration helps the bcp
algorithm with finding good integer solutions in the early stages of the al-
gorithm. The method has show to result in reasonable good solutions for
the vrptw. Prescott-Gagnon et al. [55] have improved the heuristic ap-
proach for bcp algorithms further by integrating the bcp algorithm with
large neighbourhood search. For bac algorithms methods such as local
branching introduced by Fischetti and Lodi [28] and the feasibility pump
introduced by Fischetti et al. [29] can be used to find fast and good solu-
tions. The main benefit of the exact solution approach is that it provides
both an upper and lower bound.
Though when a fast good solution is needed a heuristics such as the
adaptive large scale neighbourhood search by Pisinger and Ropke [54] for
cvrp, vrptw and many other Vehicle Routing variants or the local search
heuristic by Zachariadis and Kiranoudis [65] are preferable.
