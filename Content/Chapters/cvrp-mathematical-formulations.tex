\chapter{Mathematical formulations for the CVRP}
\label{sec:cvrp-mathematical-formulations}

In this chapter we present the CVRP through some very well known mathematical formulations.
These mathematical formulations are expressed through (Mixed) Integer Programming (MIP, IP)
models.
We present three total mathematical models:

\begin{enumerate}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
	\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}

	\item The two-index arc flow formulation \parencite{laporte1983, laporte1985, laporte1986}.
	\item The three-index arc flow formulation \parencite{golden1977}.
	\item The Set Partitioning (SP) formulation \parencite{balinski1964}.
\end{enumerate}

The first two formulations, traditionally designed
for branch-and-cut (\textbf{BAC}) algorithms, employ a polynomial number of variables
but use an exponential number of constraints.
The latter formulation, instead, makes use of a polynomial number of constraints,
but uses an exponential number of variables.
Despite the SP formulation being older, in later years thanks to algorithmic advances
and the development of efficient branch-and-price (\textbf{BAP}) frameworks, it has become the de facto
state-of-the-art core ingredient for solving CVRP problems (see \cite{pessoa2020}).
Another, less common formulation, based on a two-commodity flow description
can be found in \textcite{baldacci2004}.

\section{Mathematical notation}
\label{sec:cvrp-mathematical-notation}

Before presenting each formulation we first need to define some basic notation
and mathematical quantities that will be used throughout the remainder of the thesis.

The CVRP is traditionally described as a node routing problem modeled through a symmetric and complete graph theoretical problem,
where: (i) the vertices of the network represent the customers and the depot,
(ii) the edges represent road interconnections.
Let $G = \Tuple*{V, E}$ denote a \textbf{complete undirected network}, where $V = \Set*{0, 1, \dots, N - 1}$ denotes the set of nodes,
$E = \Set*{e = \Set*{i, j} = \Set*{j, i} \mid \allowbreak i,j \in V, \allowbreak i \ne j}$ the set of undirected edges,
and $N$ the total number of nodes in the network.
The value $0 \in V$ is used to denote the depot node.
The edge set $E$ has size $|E|$, which can be computed through combinatorial enumeration: $|E| = \frac{N (N+1)}{2}$.
For convenience, we define $V_0 = V \setminus \Set*{0}$ to express the set of customers,
and $N_0 = N - 1$ to denote the total number of customers.
Let $\delta(S)$ with $S \subseteq V$ denote the edges crossing the set $S$ and its complement $\overline{S} = V \setminus S$.
More formally we can express $\delta(S)$ as $\delta(S) = \Set*{ e = \Set*{i, j} = \Set*{j, i} \in E \mid i \in \Expr*{S \cap V}, j \in \Expr*{ \overline{S} \cap V } }$.
For brevity, we also define $\delta(i) = \delta(\Set*{i})$ to denote the set of edges incident to node $i \in V$.
We also define $E(S) = \Set*{e = \Set*{i, j} = \Set*{j, i}\in E \mid i, j \in S}$ to denote the set of edges having both end points in set $S \subseteq V$.

Let $q_{i} \in \R,\ q_{i} \ge 0 \quad \forall i \in V$ denote the demand function, which represent the required demand that need to be served for vertex $i \in V$.
For convenience, we fix a fictitious demand for the depot: $q_0 = 0$.
Given a set $S \subseteq V$, we define $q(S) = \sum_{i \in S} q_i$ as the total demand of the set $S \subseteq V$.
Let $c_{ij} \in \R, c_{ij} > 0$ denote the distance function between a pair of nodes  $i, j \in V$.
The loop arcs $\Set*{i, i} \notin E$ in CVRP are traditionally not allowed, thus we fix $c_{ii} = \infty$.
We assume a Euclidean CVRP problem, i.e. the distance function is symmetric $c_e = c_{ij} = c_{ji}$ and satisfies the triangle inequality $c_{ij} \le c_{ih} + c_{hj}$.
We are also given the total number of identical trucks $K \in \N_+$ and an upper bound $Q \in \R_+$ representing the capacity of each truck.
For convenience of notation, we also define $\mcK = \Set*{1, \dots, K}$ to denote the set of trucks.
Given a set $S \subseteq V_0$, we denote by $r(S)$ as the minimum number of vehicles required to serve all customers $i \in S$.
The value of $r(S)$ can be obtained by solving an NP-hard Bin Packing Problem associated with the CVRP and set $S$.
As we will see later, it is often simpler to link $r(S)$ to the trivial lower bound of the Bin Packing Problem \parencite{martello1990}:

\begin{equation}
	r(S) \ge \ceil*{\frac{q(S)}{Q}}
\end{equation}

A route $p$ is a loop-back sequence $p = \Tuple*{p_0, p_1, \dots, p_u, p_{u + 1}}$,
with $p_0 = p_{u + 1} = 0$
in which $\Set*{p_1, \dots, p_u} \subseteq V_0$ customers are visited.
The route $p$ has a travel cost of $c_p = c(p) = \sum_{i=0}^{u} c_{p_i,p_{i+1}}$
with resource consumption $q_p = q(p) = \sum_{i=0}^{u} q_{i}$.
A feasible solution to a CVRP problem consists of \textbf{exactly} $K$ routes (or circuits)
associated with each vehicle starting and ending at the depot node.
The traditional definition of CVRP requires full use of the total number of available vehicles $K$,
however,
this requirement can lead to suboptimal solutions with respect to using fewer vehicles for some cases.
In classic CVRP, each customer is visited exactly once (elementarity condition),
and the sum of the customer demands visited in each tour does not exceed the vehicle capacity $q(p) \le Q$.
An optimal solution to the CVRP is a feasible solution which minimizes the sum of the overall edge weights across all the tours.

\medskip

The TSP can be considered a special case of CVRP where $Q \ge q(V)$ and $K = 1$.
Therefore, all the relaxations and many results obtained for the TSP are valid, or at least extendable, to the CVRP.

\medskip

Some variants of the basic version of the CVRP, not considered in this thesis, allows using only a subset of the total available vehicles,
or consider a heterogeneous fleet characterized by different capacities $Q_1, \dots, Q_k$.
In the remainder of this section we introduce the two most common IP mathematical formulations for the classical version of the CVRP.

\section{The two-index arc flow formulation}
\label{sec:cvrp-two-index-flow-formulation}

The two-index arc flow formulation (2F) was first presented in \cite{laporte1983, laporte1985} for the symmetric case,
and later generalized to the undirected case in \cite{laporte1986}.

The two-index arc flow formulation is traditionally tackled with branch-and-cut frameworks.
We define a set of integer variables $x_e \in \Set*{0, 1, 2}$ to indicate the number of times
a vehicle traverses edge $e = \Set*{i, j} = \Set*{j, i} \in E$ in the optimal solution.
There are $O(N^2)$ number of integer variables in the model.
The two-index arc flow formulation can be described as an Integer Programme (IP):

\begin{align}
	\min_{x} \quad z_\mt{2F}(x) & = \sum_{e \in E} c_e x_e \label{eq:two-index-flow-obj-func}                                                                                        \\
	                            & \sum_{e \in \delta(i)} x_e = 2                              & \quad \forall i \in V_0 \label{eq:two-index-flow-two-edges-incident-per-customer}    \\
	                            & \sum_{e \in \delta(0)} x_e = 2 K                            & \label{eq:two-index-flow-two-k-edges-incident-in-the-depot-node}                     \\
	                            & \sum_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e \ge 2 r(S)                       & \quad \forall S \subseteq V_0,\ |S| \ge 1 \label{eq:two-index-flow-ccc}              \\
	                            & x_e                   \in \Set*{0, 1, 2}                    & \quad \forall e \in \delta(0) \label{eq:two-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot}       \\
	                            & x_e                   \in \Set*{0, 1}                       & \quad \forall e \in E \setminus \delta(0) \label{eq:two-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds}
\end{align}

where $z_\mt{2F}(x)$, as defined in \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-obj-func}, is the objective function meant to minimize the overall routing cost (travel time).
Constraint \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-two-edges-incident-per-customer} is the degree constraint which imposes flow conservation: exactly two incident edges must be picked for each customer.
Constraint \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-two-k-edges-incident-in-the-depot-node}, is the degree constraint at the depot, it forces that exactly $2K$ incident edges at the depot are picked, thus forcing exactly $K$ routes to be constructed.
Constraints \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot} and \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds} forces each edge to be traversed at most once,
except for all edges incident at the depot.
The edge-case modeled in constraint \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot} is necessary to allow single-customer routes.
Constraint \eqref{eq:two-index-flow-ccc}, are the so-called Capacity Cut Constraints (CCC), also called Rounded Capacity Constraints (RCC), they function both:
(i) as Subtour Elimination Constraints (SECs), by imposing connectivity of the solution by avoiding the formation of spurious unconnected subtours,
and (ii) as a capacity constraint, by imposing that any customer set $S$ is crossed by a number of edges not smaller than $r(S)$.
Recall that, $r(S)$ represents the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all customers in set $S$,
also, $r(S)$ always satisfies $r(S) \ge 1$ for non-trivial CVRP instances: $q(S) > 0$.

It was shown in \textcite{martello1990knapsack, cornuejols1993}, that it is possible to replace $r(S)$ in constraint
\eqref{eq:two-index-flow-ccc}, with the much simpler Bin Packing Problem lower bound $\ceil*{q(S) / Q}$
thus obtaining the following inequality:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:two-index-flow-ccc-bpp-lb}
	\sum_{e \in \delta(S)} x_e \ge 2 \ceil*{\frac{q(S)}{Q}}   \quad \forall S \subseteq V_0, |S| \ge 1
\end{equation}

The looser inequality of \cref{eq:two-index-flow-ccc-bpp-lb} is sufficient to optimally solve
the two-index arc flow formulation.
Although, a better lower bound for the Bin Packing Problem can improve the linear
relaxation, thus reducing the number of branching occurrences.

The CCC constraints in \cref{eq:two-index-flow-ccc}, may be transformed in the so called Generalized Subtour Elimination Constraints (GSEC) \parencite{laporte1985},
by means of the degree constraints of \cref{eq:two-index-flow-two-edges-incident-per-customer,eq:two-index-flow-two-k-edges-incident-in-the-depot-node}:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:cvrp-2flow-gsec}
	\sum_{e \in E(S)} x_{ij} \le |S| - r(S) \quad \forall S \subseteq V_0,\ |S| \ge 1
\end{equation}

where, again, $r(S)$ may be replaced by the trivial Bin Packing Problem lower bound $\ceil*{q(S) / Q}$.

The GSEC avoid the formation of spurious unconnected subtours and impose that at least $r(S)$ edges leave set $S$.
The number of GSEC (or CCC) inequalities appear in exponential number in the two-index formulation model,
thus making a direct solution of the linear relaxation impractical.
To overcome this issue, it is possible to avoid adding the GSEC inequalities statically in the model.
Instead, an appropriate cutting-plane algorithm and separation procedure may be employed to generate dynamically
only the necessary (violated) GSECs constraints
during the running time of the branch-and-cut algorithm,

Another approach is to avoid the usage of the exponential number of SECS entirely.
This is the approach taken by the so-called compact models (see \cite{miller1960, christofides1979vehicle, desrochers1991}).
These models make use of a polynomial number of constraints.
Unfortunately these compact formulations are known to produce significantly weaker linear relaxations.
In fact, it has been mathematically proven,
that the SECs are very strong for the TSP: they are facet-defining for the polytope;
i.e. they uniquely characterize the convex-hull \parencite{grotschel1975}.
However, similar mathematical proofs cannot be extended to the CVRP,
since due to the more complex structure of this generalized problem,
little satisfactory results have been obtained in studying the polyhedral characteristics
for even the standard variation of the VRP, see \textcite{campos1991, cornuejols1993}.

Unfortunately, as it was proven in \textcite{augerat1995} the separation problem
for the capacity cut constraints is NP-complete, thus limiting the applicability
of this formulation for solving the CVRP.
For this reason, some authors \parencite{augerat1995, augerat1998, ralphs2003} designed
several fractional separation heuristics for the CCC.
However,
an exact CCC separation is required for integral solutions
to ensure the correctness of the optimal solution.
\textcite{lysgaard2003cvrpsep} implements efficient
heuristics for separating the CCC of \cref{eq:two-index-flow-ccc}.

\section{The three-index arc flow formulation}
\label{sec:cvrp-three-index-flow-formulation}

When modeling more "colorful" variations of the CVRP,
the two-index arc flow model falls short in providing sufficient descriptive power.
For example,
the simple CVRP variant where the fleet of trucks is heterogeneous
and characterized by capacities $Q_1, \dots, Q_K$,
cannot be described with the two-index arc flow formulation,
since there's no clear one-to-one mapping on which truck crosses an edge $e \in E$.

The three-index arc flow formulation (3F),
first presented in \textcite{golden1977},
fixes this issue.
The 3F formulation makes use $O(N^2 K + N K)$ integer variables.
A set of integer variables $x_{ek} \in \Set*{0, 1, 2},\ e = \Set*{i, j} \in E,\ k \in \mcK$
is used to encode the number of times a truck $k$ traverses an edge $e \in E$.
Another set of binary variables $y_{ik} \in \Set*{0, 1},\ i \in V,\ k \in \mcK$
is used to model whether truck $k$ covers a node $i \in V$.

The three-index arc flow formulation can be described as an Integer Programme (IP):

\begin{align}
	\min_{x, y} \quad z_\mt{3F}(x, y) & = \sum_{k \in \mcK} \sum_{e \in E} c_{e} x_{ek} \label{eq:three-index-flow-obj-func}                                                                                                                           \\
	                                  & \sum_{k \in \mcK} y_{ik} = 1                                                         & \quad \forall i \in V_0                                              \label{eq:three-index-flow-all-customers-visited}  \\
	                                  & \sum_{k \in \mcK} y_{0k} = K                                                         & \label{eq:three-index-flow-tour-starts-and-ends-at-depot}                                                               \\
	                                  & \sum_{e \in \delta(i)} x_{ek} = 2 y_{ik}                                             & \quad \forall i \in V,\ \forall k \in \mcK \label{eq:three-index-flow-force-visited-customer-if-flow}                   \\
	                                  & \sum_{i \in V} q_i y_{ik} \le Q                                                      & \quad \forall k \in \mcK \label{eq:three-index-flow-force-resource-upper-bound}                                         \\
	                                  & \sum_{e \in \delta(S)} x_{ek} \ge 2 y_{hk}                                           & \quad \forall h \in S,\ \forall S \subseteq V_0,\ |S| \ge 2,\ \forall k \in \mcK \label{eq:three-index-flow-secv1}      \\
	                                  & x_{ek}                   \in \Set*{0, 1, 2}                                          & \quad \forall e \in \delta(0),\ \forall k \in \mcK             \label{eq:three-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot}       \\
	                                  & x_{ek}                   \in \Set*{0, 1}                                             & \quad \forall e \in E \setminus \delta(0),\ \forall k \in \mcK             \label{eq:three-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds} \\
	                                  & y_{ik}                    \in \Set*{0, 1}                                            & \quad \forall i \in V,\ \forall k \in \mcK  \label{eq:three-index-flow-y-mip-var-bounds}
\end{align}

where $z_\mt{3F}(x, y)$, as defined in \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-obj-func}, is the objective function to be minimized (i.e. the overall travel distance).
Constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-all-customers-visited} forces all customers to be served exactly once.
Constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-tour-starts-and-ends-at-depot} forces all the truck tours to start at the depot and end at the same spot.
Constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-force-visited-customer-if-flow} binds the $y_{ik}$ variables to the corresponding $x_{ijk}$ variables, by ensuring that if a truck's route passes through a vertex, then the corresponding node is marked as visited.
Constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-force-resource-upper-bound} is the capacity upper bound constraint and it ensures that the demand served by each truck does not exceed the truck capacity.
Constraints \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-secv1} are the Generalized Subtour Elimination Constraints (GSECs), they impose the connectivity of the route and are used to avoid the formation of spurious unconnected subtours.
Constraints \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot} and \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds} forces each edge to be traversed at most once,
except for all edges incident at the depot.
The edge-case modeled in constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-x-mip-var-bounds-depot}
is necessary to allow single-customer routes.
Finally, constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-y-mip-var-bounds}
bounds and forces integrality for the $y_{ik}$ binary variables.

Constraint \eqref{eq:three-index-flow-secv1} may be replaced in an equivalent form
with traditional (non generalized) TSP subtour elimination constraints (see \textcite{fisher1981}):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:three-index-flow-secv2}
	\sum_{e \in E(S)} x_{ek} \le |S| - 1 \quad \forall S \subseteq V_0, |S| \ge 2,\ \forall k \in \mcK
\end{equation}

Since the number of (G)SECs is exponential in the number of nodes $N$, they are usually not inserted statically in the model but are generated lazily within the running time of the resolution process.

The three-index arc flow model generalizes the two-index version.
In fact, the two-index arc flow model may be viewed as a special case of the three-index by aggregating
all $x_{ek}$ into a single variable $x_e$:

\begin{equation}
	x_e = \sum_{k \in \mcK} x_{ek} \quad \forall e \in E
\end{equation}

However, the three-index arc flow formulation suffers a major downside compared to the two-index version.
When modeling homogeneous fleets CVRPs the 3F model suffers from a multiplicity of the solution space.
In fact, since all the vehicles share the same capacity,
new feasible solutions can be obtained through symmetry by simply permuting the identity $k \in \mcK$ of each truck.

\section{The Set Partitioning (SP) formulation}
\label{sec:set-partitionining-formulation}

The Set Partitioning (SP) formulation,
sometimes also called Path Flow formulation,
is an extended formulation, which was originally presented in \textcite{balinski1964}.
It works substantially differently from the two/three-index arc flow formulation
or many other commonly encountered IP models.
The SP formulation uses a very small number of constraints
while offloading much of the search-space complexity to an exponential number of binary variables.

The SP formulation can be viewed as a Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition \parencite{dantzig1960}
and commodity aggregation \parencite{desaulniers1998}
of the three-index arc flow formulation.
The Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation approach is an application of a
decomposition principle where one chooses to solve many smaller sizes
structured sub-problems instead of being confronted to
the original problem resolution complexity are beyond what can be
solved in reasonable time \parencite{vanderbeck2005}.
Let $P = \Set*{p \mid p\ \text{is a single-truck feasible route}}$ be the set of all feasible routes.
Let $\lambda_p \in \Set*{0, 1}$ be a binary variable indicating whether route $p$ is selected.
Let $a_{ip}, a_{ep} \in \Z$ be "static encodings" (integer coefficients)
for a route $p \in P$ that respectively count
the number of times vertex $i \in V$ or an edge $e \in E$ is covered.

We recall that $c_p = c(p)$ represents the cost of a feasible route $p \in P$,
which can be trivially computed in $O(N)$.
The SP model forces $K$ routes $\Tuple*{p_1, \dots, p_K} \in P^K$ to be included in the optimal solution.

The SP formulation is described through an Integer Programme (IP):

\begin{align}
	\min_{\lambda} \quad z_\mt{SP}(\lambda) & = \sum_{p \in P}  c_p \lambda_p \label{eq:set-partitioning-obj-func}                                                                                                                                           \\
	                                        & \sum_{p \in P} \lambda_{p} = K\label{eq:set-partitioning-K-routes}                                                                                                                                             \\
	                                        & \sum_{p \in P}  a_{ip} \lambda_p = 1                                 & \quad \forall i \in V_0                                              \label{eq:set-partitioning-customers-visited-by-exactly-one-route} \\
	                                        & \lambda_p                    \in \Set*{0, 1}                         & \quad \forall p \in P \label{eq:set-partitioning-lambda-mip-var-bounds}

where, $z_\mt{SP}(\lambda)$, as defined in \eqref{eq:set-partitioning-obj-func} is the objective function to be minimized (i.e. the overall travel distance).
Constraint \eqref{eq:set-partitioning-customers-visited-by-exactly-one-route} forces each customer to be covered by exactly one route.
Constraint \eqref{eq:set-partitioning-K-routes} enforces that exactly $K$ routes are selected.
Finally, constraint \eqref{eq:set-partitioning-lambda-mip-var-bounds} is the bounding and integrality constraints for binary variables $\lambda_p \ \forall p \in P$.

As one may guess,
due the exponential number of binary variables,
the SP formulation cannot be instantiated nor directly solved.
However,
a variant of the SP formulation can be tackled efficiently by Column Generation (CG) approaches
embedded inside a branch-and-price (BAP) framework.
Branch-and-price frameworks and column generation have been applied
with high success to the vehicle routing problems.

As, \textcite{toth2002} point out, if the distance matrix satisfies the triangle inequality,
than it is possible to rewrite the SP formulation into a totally equivalent Set Covering (SC) formulation
by substituting \cref{eq:set-partitioning-customers-visited-by-exactly-one-route} in favor of the simpler inequality:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:set-covering-customers-visited-by-exactly-one-route}
	\sum_{p \in P}  a_{ip} \lambda_p \ge 1  \quad \forall i \in V_0
\end{equation}

The set of feasible paths $p \in P$ in the SC formulation
become all non-elementary routes that respect the vehicle capacity.
Under the triangle inequality assumption,
any feasible solution for the SP formulation is also feasible for the SC formulation.
Transforming the SP to the SC formulation vastly shrinks (halves) the size of the dual solution space.

\medskip

The SP formulation has two main advantages.
First, its linear relaxation provides excellent lower bounds \parencite{bramel1997},
compared to the two or three arc flow formulation.
Second, it can handle many VRP variants,
even described through very complex constraints,
since their definitions are captured within the definition of the set $P$ itself.

In the next sections we will introduce
the branch-and-price (BAP) framework and the Column Generation (CG) approach,
key components employed in contemporary CVRP solvers.
Refer to \textcite{vanderbeck2005, lubbecke2005} for a review on column generation
approaches to solve generic MIP problems.
