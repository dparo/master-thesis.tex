\section{CVRP Benchmark Instances}
\label{sec:results-benchmark-instances}

\mytodo{Introduce the original benchmark used and their naming convention, and filename convention <F>-n<X>-k<Y>}

\mytodo{Talk about how benchmark instances are obtained}

\mytodo{Say that they follow the TSPLIB95 file format}

\mytodo{Say that the distances are rounded. Refer to \cite{uchoa2017}, which contains a small explanation why this is done}

THE CVRPLIB website
The typical instance repository of today is a web page that allows downloading the instance
files and includes additional textual information, like file format description, instance
source, best known/optimal solution values, etc. The CVRLIB web page, where the new
instances (and all the previous CVRP instances described in Section 2) are available
(http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/index.php/en/), is more sophisticated:
\end{comment}

\mytodo{Put all the instances used in tables as is done in \cite{uchoa2017}}

\section{Evaluation Method}
\label{sec:results-evaluation-method}

\section{Performance profiles}
\label{sec:results-performance-profiles}

\mytodo{Explain what are performance profiles and how to interpret them}

\section{Empirical Results}
\label{sec:results-empirical-results}
\mytodo{Spam this section with performance profiles}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:results-discussion}

We noticed many branch-and-bound nodes being generated,
suggesting that a smarter and more effective bounding technique to
generate an effective initial dual bound could speed up the convergence
of the MIP solver by reducing the number of branching occurrences.

Heuristic algorithm to solve maxflow???
