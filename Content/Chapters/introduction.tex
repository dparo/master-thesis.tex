\section{The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)}

The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) can be considered as a generalization of
the well-known Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).
It was first formulated in \cite{dantzig1959truck}
under the initial name of "the truck dispatching problem".
