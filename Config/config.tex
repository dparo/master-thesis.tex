% (added at TeX3)
% is used if TeX can not set the paragraph below the \tolerance badness,
% but rather than make overfull boxes it tries an extra pass "pretending" that every
% line has an additional \emergencystretch of stretchable glue, this allows the
% overall badness to be kept below 1000 and stops TeX "giving up" and putting
% all stretch into one line. So \emergencystretch does not change the setting of "good"
% paragraphs, it only changes the setting of paragraphs that would have produced
% over-full boxes. Note that you get warnings about the real badness calculation
% from TeX even though it retries with \emergencystretch the extra stretch
% is used to control the typesetting but it is not considered as good
% for the purposes of logging.
\emergencystretch 3em
